[[sacrifice]]s has followers in some [[Smartism|Sm\[ABar]rta]] [[br\[ABar]hma\

[[Yajurveda|Yajurvedis]] or [[Namboothiri]]s of [[Kerala]], Gurukkal Brahmins \

different method and do 24 Tila-tarpa\:1e47a, as  Lord [[Krishna]] had done \
tarpa\:1e47a on the day before [[Amavasya|am\[ABar]v\[ABar]sy\[ABar]]];  they \
call themselves Baudh\[ABar]yana Amavasya.\\n\\n==Baudh\[ABar]yana Dharmas\
\:016btra==\\nThe Dharmas\:016btra of Baudh\[ABar]yana like that of \
[[Apastamba]] also forms a part of the larger [[Kalpa \
S\:016btra|Kalpasutra]]. Likewise, it is composed of ''[[pra\:015bna]]s'' \
which literally means \[OpenCurlyQuote]questions\[CloseCurlyQuote] or books. \
The structure of this Dharmas\:016btra is not very clear because it came down \
in an incomplete manner. Moreover, the text has undergone alterations in the \
form of additions and explanations over a period of time. The \
''pra\:015bnas'' consist of the [[Srautasutra]] and other ritual treatises, \
the Sulvasutra which deals with vedic geometry, and the [[Grhyasutra]] which \
deals with domestic rituals.<ref name=\\\"Patrick Olivelle 1999 \

commentaries on this Dharmas\:016btra with the exception of \
[[Govindasv\[ABar]min]]'s ''Vivara\:1e47a''. The date of the commentary is \
uncertain but according to Olivelle it is not very ancient. Also the \
commentary is inferior in comparison to that of Haradatta on \

divided into four books. Olivelle states that Book One and the first sixteen \
chapters of Book Two are the \[OpenCurlyQuote]Proto-Baudhayana\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]<ref name=\\\"Patrick Olivelle 1999 p.127\\\" /> even \
though this section has undergone alteration. Scholars like \
B\[UDoubleDot]hler and Kane agree that the last two books of the \
Dharmas\:016btra are later additions. Chapter 17 and 18 in Book Two lays \
emphasis on various types of ascetics and acetic practices.<ref \

devoted to the student and deals in topics related to studentship. It also \
refers to social classes, the role of the king, marriage, and suspension of \
Vedic recitation. Book two refers to penances, inheritance, women, \
householder, orders of life, ancestral offerings. Book three refers to holy \
householders, forest hermit and penances. Book four primarily refers to the \
yogic practices and penances along with offenses regarding \
marriage.<ref>Patrick Olivelle, Dharmas\:016btras: The Law Codes of Ancient \

right-angled isosceles triangles, however, it would constitute a less general \

by Baudh\[ABar]yana is that of finding a circle whose area is the same as \
that of a square (the reverse of [[squaring the circle]]). His s\:016btra \
i.58 gives this construction:\\n\\n:''Draw half its diagonal about the centre \
towards the East-West line; then describe a circle together with a third part \
of that which lies outside the square. ''\\n\\nExplanation:\\n*Draw the \
half-diagonal of the square, which  is larger than the half-side by <math>x = \
{a \\\\over 2}\\\\sqrt{2}- {a \\\\over 2}</math>.\\n*Then draw a circle with \
radius <math>{a \\\\over 2} + {x \\\\over 3}</math>, or <math>{a \\\\over 2} \
+ {a \\\\over 6}(\\\\sqrt{2}-1)</math>, which equals <math>{a \\\\over 6}(2 + \
\\\\sqrt{2})</math>.\\n* Now <math>(2+\\\\sqrt{2})^2 \\\\approx 11.66 \
\\\\approx {36.6\\\\over \\\\pi}</math>, so the area <math>{\\\\pi}r^2 \
\\\\approx \\\\pi \\\\times {a^2 \\\\over 6^2} \\\\times {36.6\\\\over \

i.61-2 (elaborated in \[CapitalABar]pastamba Sulbas\:016btra i.6)\\ngives the \

bisect at right angles, area of a square formed by joining the middle points \
of a square is half of original, the\\nmidpoints of a rectangle joined forms \
a rhombus whose area is half the rectangle, etc.\\n\\nNote the emphasis on \

BC &ndash; 690 BC) is an author of the [[Hindu]] [[Geometry|geometric]] text \
of ''[[Sulba Sutras]].''\\n\\nThe Manava [[Sulbasutra]] is not the oldest \
(the one by [[Baudhayana]] is older), nor is it one of the most important, \
there being at least three Sulbasutras which are considered more important. \
Historians place his lifetime at around 750 BC.\\n\\nManava would have not \
have been a mathematician in the sense that we would understand it today. Nor \
was he a scribe who simply copied manuscripts like [[Ahmes]]. He would \
certainly have been a man of very considerable learning but probably not \
interested in mathematics for its own sake, merely interested in using it for \
religious purposes. Undoubtedly he wrote the ''Sulbasutra'' to provide rules \
for religious rites and it would appear almost a certainty that Manava \
himself would be a [[Hindu]] priest.\\n\\nThe mathematics given in the \
''Sulbasutras'' is there to enable accurate construction of altars needed for \
sacrifices. It is clear from the writing that Manava, as well as being a \
priest, must have been a skilled craftsman.\\n\\nManava's ''Sulbasutra,'' \
like all the ''Sulbasutras,'' contained approximate constructions of circles \
from rectangles, and squares from circles, which can be thought of as giving \
approximate values of \[Pi]. There appear therefore different values of \[Pi] \
throughout the ''Sulbasutra,'' essentially every construction involving \
circles leads to a different such approximation. The paper of R.C. Gupta is \
concerned with an interpretation of verses 11.14 and 11.15 of Manava's work \
which give \[Pi] = 25/8 = 3.125.\\n\\n==External links==\\n*{{MacTutor \

explaining natural objects and phenomena by [[Theory|theories]] and \

\\n===Background===\\nThe dates of Thales' life are not exactly known, but \
are roughly established by a few datable events mentioned in the sources. \
According to [[Herodotus]] (and as determined by modern methods) Thales \
predicted the [[Eclipse of Thales|solar eclipse of May 28, 585&nbsp;BC]].<ref \
name=\\\"1.74.2\\\">Herodotus, \
[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt.+1.74.1 1.74.2], and \
A. D. Godley's footnote 1; Pliny, \
[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+2.9 2.9 (12)] \
and Bostock's footnote 2.</ref> [[Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius]] quotes the \
chronicle of Apollodorus of Athens as saying that Thales died at the age of \
78 during the 58th [[Olympiad]] (548\[Dash]545&nbsp;BC) and attributes his \
death to [[heat stroke]] while watching the games. \\n\\nDiogenes La\
\[EDoubleDot]rtius states that \\\"according to Herodotus and Douris and \
[[Democritus]]\\\", Thales' parents were Examyes and Cleobuline, whose names \
are indigenous Carian and Greek, respectively.<ref name=\\\"Freely2012\\\"/> \
Diogenes then delivers conflicting reports: one that Thales married and \
either fathered a son ([[Cybisthus]] or [[Cybisthon]]) or adopted his nephew \
of the same name; the second that he never married, telling his mother as a \
young man that it was too early to marry, and as an older man that it was too \
late. [[Plutarch]] had earlier told this version: [[Solon]] visited Thales \
and asked him why he remained single; Thales answered that he did not like \
the idea of having to worry about children. Nevertheless, several years \
later, anxious for family, he adopted his nephew Cybisthus.<ref>{{cite book \

|location=Chicago |pages=66 |chapter=Solon |editor=Robert Maynard Hutchins \
|series=Great Books of the Western World |volume=14}}</ref>\\n\\nThales \
involved himself in many activities, taking the role of an innovator. Some \
say that he left no writings, others say that he wrote ''On the \
[[Solstice]]'' and ''On the [[Equinox]]''. (No writing attributed to him has \
survived.) Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius quotes two letters from Thales: one \
to [[Pherecydes of Syros]], offering to review his book on religion, and one \
to [[Solon]], offering to keep him company on his sojourn \
from{{Clarify|date=February 2017}} [[Athens]]. Thales identifies the \
Milesians as Athenian [[Colonies in antiquity#Greek \
colonies|colonists]].<ref>Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius, 1.43, \
44.</ref>\\n\\n===Engineering===\\nThales' principal occupation was \
[[engineering]].<ref>J J O'Connor and E F Robertson, \
[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Thales.html Thales \
of Miletus], University of St Andrews [Retrieved 2016-06-16]</ref>\\n\\nHe \
was aware of the existence of the [[lodestone]], and was the first to be \
connected to knowledge of this in history. According to Aristotle, Thales \
thought lodestones had souls, because iron is attracted to them (by the force \
of [[magnetism]]).<ref>Nathan Ida, \
[https://books.google.com/books?id=YtmIBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA427 ''Engineering \
Electromagnetics''], Springer, 2015 {{isbn|3319078062}}</ref> According to \
[[Hieronymus of Rhodes|Hieronymus]], historically quoted by [[Diogenes \
Laertius]], Thales found the height of pyramids by comparison between the \
lengths of the shadows cast by a person and by the pyramids.<ref>J J O'Connor \
and E F Robertson</ref>\\n\\n===Business===\\n[[File:Capernaum roman olive \
press by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|An olive mill and an olive press dating \
from Roman times in [[Capernaum, Israel]].]]\\nSeveral anecdotes suggest \
Thales was not just a philosopher, but also a businessman.\\n\\nA story, with \
different versions, recounts how Thales achieved riches from an olive harvest \
by [[Weather forecasting#Ancient forecasting|prediction of the \
weather]].\\n\\nIn one version, he bought all the [[Olive oil \
extraction#Traditional method: olive press|olive presses]] in Miletus after \
predicting the weather and a good harvest for a particular year. Another \
version of the story has Aristotle explain that Thales had reserved presses \
in advance, at a discount, and could rent them out at a high price when \
demand peaked, following his prediction of a particularly good harvest. \
Aristotle explains that Thales' objective in doing this was not to enrich \
himself but to prove to his fellow Milesians that philosophy could be useful, \
contrary to what they thought,<ref>Aristotle, [[Politics \
(Aristotle)|Politics]] 1259a \
[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Pol.+1.1259a]</\
ref> or alternatively, Thales had made his foray into enterprise because of a \
personal challenge put to him by an individual who had asked why, if Thales \
was an intelligent famous philosopher, he had yet to attain wealth. This \
first version of the story would constitute the first historically known \
creation and use of [[Futures contract|futures]], whereas the second version \
would be the first historically known of creation and use of [[Option \
(finance)|options]].<ref>George Crawford, Bidyut Sen - \

Decision Makers: Strategic Management Issues]'', John Wiley & Sons, 1996 \
{{isbn|9780471129943}}</ref>\\n\\n===Politics===\\nThales\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
political life had mainly to do with the involvement of the [[Ionians]] in \
the defense of [[Anatolia]] against the growing power of the [[Achaemenid \
Empire|Persians]], who were then new to the region. In neighbouring \
[[Lydia]], a king had come to power: [[Croesus]], who was somewhat too \
aggressive for the size of his army. He had conquered most of the states of \
coastal Anatolia, including the cities of the Ionians. The story is told in \
[[Herodotus]].<ref>[[Herodotus]], Book 1</ref>\\n\\nThe Lydians were at war \
with the [[Medes]], who were a remnant of the first wave of migration of \
ancient Iranian peoples, who had subsequently settled into the region, over \
the issue of refuge the Lydians had given to some [[Scythian]] \
[[Mercenary|soldiers of fortune]] inimical to the Medes. The war endured for \
five years, but in the sixth an eclipse of the Sun (mentioned above) \
spontaneously halted a battle in progress (the [[Battle of Halys \
(585&nbsp;BC)|Battle of Halys]]).\\n\\nIt seems that Thales had predicted \
this [[solar eclipse]]. The [[Seven Sages of Greece|Seven Sages]] were most \
likely already in existence, as Croesus was also heavily influenced by \
[[Solon]] of [[Athens]], another sage. Whether Thales was present at the \
battle is not known, nor are the exact terms of the prediction, but based on \
it the Lydians and Medes made peace immediately, swearing a [[Blood \
brother|blood oath]].\\n\\nThe Medes were [[Dependent \
territory|dependencies]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] under [[Cyrus \
the Great|Cyrus]]. Croesus now sided with the Medes against the Persians and \
marched in the direction of Iran (with far fewer men than he needed). He was \
stopped by the river [[Halys River|Halys]], then unbridged. This time he had \
Thales with him, perhaps by invitation. Whatever his status, the king gave \
the problem to him, and he got the army across by digging a diversion \
upstream so as to reduce the flow, making it possible to ford the river. The \
channels ran around both sides of the camp.\\n\\nThe two armies engaged at \
[[Pteria (Cappadocia)|Pteria]] in [[Cappadocia]]. As the battle was \
indecisive but paralyzing to both sides, Croesus marched home, dismissed his \
mercenaries and sent emissaries to his dependents and allies to ask them to \
dispatch fresh troops to [[Sardis]]. The issue became more pressing when the \
Persian army showed up at Sardis. [[Diogenes \
La\[EDoubleDot]rtius]]<ref>[[Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius]] 1.25</ref> tells \
us that Thales gained fame as a counselor when he advised the Milesians not \
to engage in a symmachia, a \\\"fighting together\\\", with the Lydians. This \
has sometimes been interpreted as an alliance, but a ruler does not ally with \
his subjects.\\n\\nCroesus was defeated before the city of Sardis by Cyrus, \
who subsequently spared Miletus because it had taken no action. Cyrus was so \
impressed by Croesus\[CloseCurlyQuote] wisdom and his connection with the \
sages that he spared him and took his advice on various matters.\\n\\nThe \
Ionians were now free. Herodotus says that Thales advised them to form an \
Ionian state; that is, a bouleuterion (\\\"deliberative body\\\") to be \
located at [[Teos]] in the center of [[Ionia]]. The Ionian cities should be \
demoi, or \\\"districts\\\". Miletus, however, received favorable terms from \
Cyrus. The others remained in an Ionian League of 12 cities (excluding \
Miletus now), and were subjugated by the Persians.\\n\\nWhile Herodotus \
reported that most of his fellow Greeks believe that Thales did divert the \
river Halys to assist King Croesus' military endeavors, he himself finds it \
doubtful.<ref \
name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/>\\n\\n===Sagacity===\\n[[File:MiletusIonicStoa.jpg|thumb|\
The Ionic Stoa on the Sacred Way in Miletus]]\\n[[Diogenes \
La\[EDoubleDot]rtius]]<ref>Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius 1.22</ref> tells us \
that the [[Seven Sages of Greece|Seven Sages]] were created in the \
[[archon]]ship of Damasius at [[Athens]] about 582&nbsp;BC and that Thales \
was the first sage. The same story, however, asserts that Thales emigrated to \
[[Miletus]]. There is also a report that he did not become a student of \
[[nature]] until after his political career. Much as we would like to have a \
date on the seven sages, we must reject these stories and the tempting date \
if we are to believe that Thales was a native of Miletus, predicted the \
eclipse, and was with [[Croesus]] in the campaign against [[Cyrus the \
Great|Cyrus]].\\n\\nThales received instruction from an [[Ancient \
Egypt|Egyptian]] priest. It was fairly certain that he came from a wealthy, \
established family, in a class which customarily provided higher education \
for their children. Moreover, the ordinary citizen, unless he was a seafaring \
man or a merchant, could not afford the grand tour in [[Egypt]], and did not \
consort with noble lawmakers such as [[Solon]].\\n[[File:Solar eclipse 1999 4 \
NR.jpg|thumb|left|Total [[eclipse]] of the [[Sun]]]]\\nIn Diogenes La\
\[EDoubleDot]rtius' ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers'' Chapter 1.39, La\
\[EDoubleDot]rtius relates the several stories of an expensive object that is \
to go to the most [[Wisdom#Philosophical perspectives|wise]]. In one version \
(that La\[EDoubleDot]rtius credits to [[Callimachus]] in his ''Iambics'') \
Bathycles of Arcadia states in his will that an expensive bowl \\\"'should be \
given to him who had done most good by his wisdom.'  So it was given to \
Thales, went the round of all the sages, and came back to Thales again. And \
he sent it to [[Didyma|Apollo at Didyma]], with this dedication...'Thales the \
Milesian, son of Examyas [dedicates this] to Delphinian Apollo after twice \
winning the prize from all the \
Greeks.'\\\"<ref>{{harvnb|La\[EDoubleDot]rtius|1925|loc=\[Section] 28}}</ref>\
\\n\\n=== Astronomy ===\\n{{See also|The Astrologer who Fell into a \
Well}}\\nThales predicted the [[Eclipse of Thales|solar eclipse of May 28, \
585&nbsp;BC]].<ref name=\\\"1.74.2\\\"/> Thales also described the position \
of [[Ursa Minor]], and thought the constellation might be useful as a guide \
for navigation at sea. He calculated the duration of the year and the timings \
of the [[equinoxes]] and [[solstices]]. He is additionally attributed with \
the first observation of the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] and with \
calculating the position of the [[Pleiades]].<ref>Geoffrey Stephen Kirk, John \

civilizations before them, often invoked idiosyncratic explanations of \
natural phenomena with reference to the will of \
[[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[Deity|gods]] and [[hero]]es. Instead, \
Thales aimed to explain natural phenomena via rational hypotheses that \
referenced natural processes themselves. For example, rather than assuming \
that earthquakes were the result of supernatural whims Thales explained them \
by hypothesizing that the [[Earth]] floats on water and that earthquakes \
occur when the Earth is rocked by waves.\\n\\nThales was a \
[[Hylozoism|hylozoist]] (one who thinks that matter is alive,<ref>Farrington, \
B., 1944 Greek Science. Pelican</ref> i.e. containing soul(s)). Aristotle \
wrote (''[[De Anima]]'' 411 a7-8) of Thales: ...''Thales thought all things \
are full of gods''. Aristotle posits the origin of Thales thought on matter \
generally containing souls, to Thales thinking initially on the fact of, \
because [[lodestone|magnets]] move iron, the presence of movement of matter \
indicated this matter contained life.<ref>Garrett Thomson, \

what it is in itself.\\n\\nAristotle<ref>Aristotle, ''[[Metaphysics]]'' \
983b6</ref> characterizes most of the philosophers \\\"at first\\\" \
({{lang|grc|\[Pi]\[Rho]\:1ff6\[Tau]\[Omicron]\[Nu]}}) as thinking that the \\\
\"principles in the form of matter were the only principles of all \
things\\\", where \\\"principle\\\" is [[arche]], \\\"matter\\\" is [[hyle]] \
(\\\"wood\\\" or \\\"matter\\\", \\\"material\\\") and \\\"form\\\" is \
[[eidos (philosophy)|eidos]].\\n\\n''Arche'' is translated as \\\"principle\\\
\", but the two words do not have precisely the same meaning. A [[principle]] \
of something is merely prior (related to pro-) to it either chronologically \
or logically. An arche (from {{lang|grc|\:1f04\[Rho]\[Chi]\[CurlyEpsilon]\
\[Iota]\[Nu]}}, \\\"to rule\\\") dominates an object in some way. If the \
arche is taken to be an origin, then specific causality is implied; that is, \
B is supposed to be characteristically B just because it comes from A, which \
dominates it.\\n\\nThe archai<!-- surely the reader have to recognize this \
easily as Greek plural of \:1f00\[Rho]\[Chi]\:03ae? --> that Aristotle had in \
mind in his well-known passage on the first Greek scientists are not \
necessarily chronologically prior to their objects, but are constituents of \
it. For example, in pluralism objects are composed of earth, air, fire and \
water, but those elements do not disappear with the production of the object. \
They remain as archai within it, as do the atoms of the atomists.\\n\\nWhat \
Aristotle is really saying is that the first philosophers were trying to \
define the substance(s) of which all material objects are composed. As a \
matter of fact, that is exactly what modern scientists are attempting to \
accomplish in nuclear physics, which is a second reason why Thales is \
described as the first western scientist,{{Citation needed|date=February \

38}}</ref>\\n\\n===Geometry===\\nThales was known for his innovative use of \
[[geometry]]. His understanding was theoretical as well as practical. For \
example, he said:\\n\\n{{quote|\\n{{transl|el|''Megiston topos: hapanta gar \
chorei''}} ({{lang|el|\[CapitalMu]\:03ad\[Gamma]\[Iota]\[Sigma]\[Tau]\
\[Omicron]\[Nu] \[Tau]\:03cc\[Pi]\[Omicron]\[FinalSigma]\[CenterDot] \:1f04\

\[CurlyEpsilon]\:1fd6.}})\\n\\nThe greatest is space, for it holds all \
things.<ref>{{harvnb|La\[EDoubleDot]rtius|1925|loc=\[Section] 35}}</ref>\\n}}\
\\n\\nTopos is in Newtonian-style [[space]], since the verb, chorei, has the \
connotation of yielding before things, or spreading out to make room for \
them, which is [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]]. Within this extension, \
things have a position. [[Point (geometry)|Points]], [[line \
(mathematics)|lines]], [[plane (mathematics)|planes]] and [[solid]]s related \
by [[distance]]s and [[angle]]s follow from this presumption.\\n\\nThales \
understood [[similar triangles]] and [[right triangle]]s, and what is more, \
used that knowledge in practical ways. The story is told in DL (loc. cit.) \
that he measured the height of the [[pyramids]] by their shadows at the \
moment when his own shadow was equal to his height. A right triangle with two \
equal legs is a 45-degree right triangle, all of which are similar. The \
length of the pyramid's shadow measured from the center of the pyramid at \
that moment must have been equal to its height.\\n\\nThis story indicates \
that he was familiar with the Egyptian ''[[seked]]'', or ''seqed'', the ratio \
of the run to the rise of a [[slope]] ([[cotangent]]). The ''seked'' is at \
the base of problems 56, 57, 58, 59 and 60 of the [[Rhind papyrus]] \
\[LongDash] an ancient Egyptian mathematical document.\\n\\nIn present-day \
trigonometry, cotangents require the same units for run and rise (base and \
perpendicular), but the papyrus uses [[cubits]] for rise and [[Palm \
(measurement)|palms]] for run, resulting in different (but still \
characteristic) numbers. Since there were 7 palms in a cubit, the ''seked'' \
was 7 times the cotangent.\\n\\nTo use an example often quoted in modern \
reference works, suppose the base of a pyramid is 140&nbsp;cubits and the \
angle of rise 5.25 ''seked''. The Egyptians expressed their fractions as the \
sum of fractions, but the decimals are sufficient for the example. What is \
the rise in cubits? The run is 70&nbsp;cubits, 490 palms. X, the rise, is 490 \
divided by 5.25 or 93{{frac|1|3}} cubits. These figures sufficed for the \
Egyptians and Thales. We would go on to calculate the cotangent as 70 divided \
by 93{{frac|1|3}} to get 3/4 or .75 and looking that up in a table of \
cotangents find that the angle of rise is a few minutes over 53&nbsp;degrees.\
\\n\\nWhether the ability to use the ''[[seked]]'', which preceded Thales by \
about 1000&nbsp;years, means that he was the first to define trigonometry is \
a matter of opinion. More practically Thales used the same method to measure \
the distances of ships at sea, said Eudemus as reported by [[Proclus]] \
(\\\"in Euclidem\\\"). According to Kirk & Raven (reference cited below), all \
you need for this feat is three straight sticks pinned at one end and \
knowledge of your altitude. One stick goes vertically into the ground. A \
second is made level. With the third you sight the ship and calculate the \
''seked'' from the height of the stick and its distance from the point of \
insertion to the line of sight.\\n\\nThe ''seked'' is a measure of the angle. \
Knowledge of two angles (the ''seked'' and a right angle) and an enclosed leg \
(the altitude) allows you to determine by similar triangles the second leg, \
which is the distance.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\\n\\n===Thales' \

known as [[Thales' theorem]] having to do with a triangle inscribed in a \
circle and having the circle's diameter as one leg, the other theorem being \
also called the [[intercept theorem]]. In addition [[Eudemus of \
Rhodes|Eudemus]] attributed to him the discovery that a circle is \
[[bisection|bisected]] by its diameter, that the base angles of an isosceles \
triangle are equal and that [[vertical angles]] are equal. According to a \

the Egyptians drew two intersecting lines, they would measure the vertical \
angles to make sure that they were equal. Thales concluded that one could \
prove that all vertical angles are equal if one accepted some general notions \
such as: all straight angles are equal, equals added to equals are equal, and \
equals subtracted from equals are equal.\\n\\n===Cosmology: water as a first \
principle===\\nThales' most famous philosophical position was his \
[[cosmology|cosmological]] thesis, which comes down to us through a passage \
from [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''.<ref>{{cite \
book |author=Aristotle |author-link=Aristotle |title=[[Metaphysics \
(Aristotle)|Metaphysics]] |others=983 b6 8-11}}</ref> In the work Aristotle \
unequivocally reported Thales\[CloseCurlyQuote] [[hypothesis]] about the \
nature of all [[Matter#Historical development|matter]] \[Dash] that the \
[[Arche|originating principle of nature]] was [[Material monism|a single \
material substance]]: water. Aristotle then proceeded to proffer a number of \
conjectures based on his own observations to lend some credence to why Thales \
may have advanced this idea (though Aristotle didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t hold it \
himself).\\n\\nAristotle laid out his own thinking about \
[[Hylomorphism|matter and form]] which may shed some light on the ideas of \
Thales, in ''[[Metaphysics]]'' 983 b6 8\[Dash]11, 17\[Dash]21. (The passage \
contains words that were later adopted by science with quite different \
meanings.)\\n\\n{{quote|That from which is everything that exists and from \
which it first becomes and into which it is rendered at last, its substance \
remaining under it, but transforming in qualities, that they say is the \
element and principle of things that are. \[Ellipsis]For it is necessary that \
there be some nature \
({{lang|el|\[CurlyPhi]\:03cd\[Sigma]\[Iota]\[FinalSigma]}}), either one or \
more than one, from which become the other things of the object being \
saved... Thales the founder of this type of philosophy says that it is \
water.}}\\n\\nIn this quote we see Aristotle's depiction of the problem of \
change and the definition of [[Substance theory|substance]]. He asked if an \
object changes, is it the same or different? In either case how can there be \
a change from one to the other? The answer is that the substance \\\"is saved\
\\\", but acquires or loses different qualities \
({{lang|el|\[Pi]\:03ac\[Theta]\[Eta]}}, the things you \
\\\"experience\\\").\\n\\nAristotle conjectured that Thales reached his \
conclusion by contemplating that the \\\"nourishment of all things is moist \
and that even the hot is created from the wet and lives by it.\\\" While \
Aristotle's conjecture on why Thales held water as the originating principle \
of matter is his own thinking, his statement that Thales held it as water is \
generally accepted as genuinely originating with Thales and he is seen as an \
incipient matter-and-formist.\\n\\nThales thought the Earth must be a flat \
disk which is floating in an expanse of water.<ref>{{cite EB1911 \
|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Thales-of-Miletus |title=Thales of \
Miletus}}</ref>\\n\\n[[Heraclitus (commentator)|Heraclitus Homericus]] states \
that Thales drew his conclusion from seeing moist substance turn into air, \
slime and earth. It seems likely that Thales viewed the Earth as solidifying \
from the water on which it floated and the oceans that surround \
it.\\n\\nWriting centuries later, Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius also states \
that Thales taught \\\"Water constituted ({{lang|grc|\:1f51\[Pi]\
\[CurlyEpsilon]\[Sigma]\[Tau]\:03ae\[Sigma]\[Alpha]\[Tau]\[Omicron]}}, 'stood \
under') the principle of all things.\\\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Diogenes La\

be roughly the equivalent to the later ideas of [[Anaximenes of \

[[air]].\\n\\nThe 1870 book ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and \
Mythology]]'' noted<ref name=\\\"CPM\\\"/>\\n{{quote|Thales dogma that water \
is the origin of things, that is, that it is that out of which every thing \
arises, and into which every thing resolves itself, Thales may have followed \
[[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] cosmogonies, while, unlike them, he sought to \
establish the truth of the assertion. Hence, Aristotle, immediately after he \
has called him the originator of philosophy brings forward the reasons which \
Thales was believed to have adduced in confirmation of that assertion; for \
that no written development of it, or indeed any book by ''Thales'', was \
extant, is proved by the expressions which Aristotle uses when he brings \
forward the doctrines and proofs of the [[Miletus|Milesian]]. (p. \
1016)}}\\n\\n====Influences====\\nLater [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] thinkers \
would maintain that in his choice of water Thales was influenced by \
Babylonian or Chaldean religion, that held that a god had begun creation by \
acting upon the pre-existing water. Historian Abraham Feldman holds this does \
not stand up under closer examination. In Babylonian religion the water is \
lifeless and sterile until a god acts upon it, but for Thales water itself \
was divine and creative. He maintained that \\\"All things are full of gods\\\
\", and to understand the nature of things was to discover the secrets of the \
deities, and through this knowledge open the possibility that one could be \
greater than the grandest Olympian.<ref name=\\\"Feldman\\\">{{cite journal \

other thinkers recognized the wetness of the world \\\"none of them was \
inspired to conclude that everything was ultimately aquatic.\\\"<ref \
name=\\\"Feldman\\\"/> He further points out that Thales was \\\"a wealthy \
citizen of the fabulously rich Oriental port of Miletus...a dealer in the \
staples of antiquity, wine and oil...He certainly handled the shell-fish of \
the Phoenicians that secreted the dye of imperial purple.\\\"<ref \
name=\\\"Feldman\\\"/> Feldman recalls the stories of Thales measuring the \
distance of boats in the harbor, creating mechanical improvements for ship \
navigation, giving an explanation for the [[flooding of the Nile]] (vital to \
Egyptian agriculture and Greek trade), and changing the course of the river \
Halys so an army could ford it. Rather than seeing water as a barrier Thales \
contemplated the Ionian yearly religious gathering for athletic ritual (held \
on the promontory of Mycale and believed to be ordained by the ancestral \
kindred of Poseidon, the god of the sea). He called for the Ionian mercantile \
states participating in this ritual to convert it into a democratic \
federation under the protection of Poseidon that would hold off the forces of \
pastoral Persia. Feldman concludes that Thales saw \\\"that water was a \
revolutionary leveler and the elemental factor determining the subsistence \
and business of the world\\\"<ref name=\\\"Feldman\\\"/> and \\\"the common \
channel of states.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Feldman\\\"/>\\n\\nFeldman considers \
Thales' environment and holds that Thales would have seen tears, sweat, and \
blood as granting value to a person's work and the means how life giving \
commodities travelled (whether on bodies of water or through the sweat of \
slaves and pack-animals). He would have seen that minerals could be processed \
from water such as life-sustaining salt and gold taken from rivers. He would\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve seen fish and other food stuffs gathered from it. \
Feldman points out that Thales held that the lodestone was alive as it drew \
metals to itself. He holds that Thales \\\"living ever in sight of his \
beloved sea\\\" would see water seem to draw all \\\"traffic in wine and oil, \
milk and honey, juices and dyes\\\" to itself, leading him to \\\"a vision of \
the universe melting into a single substance that was valueless in itself and \
still the source of wealth.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Feldman\\\"/> Feldman concludes \
that for Thales \\\"...water united all things. The social significance of \
water in the time of Thales induced him to discern through hardware and \
dry-goods, through soil and sperm, blood, sweat and tears, one fundamental \
fluid stuff...water, the most commonplace and powerful material known to him.\
\\\"<ref name=\\\"Feldman\\\"/> This combined with his contemporary's idea of \
\\\"[[spontaneous generation]]\\\" allow us to see how Thales could hold that \
water could be divine and creative.\\n\\nFeldman points to the lasting \
association of the theory that \\\"all whatness is wetness\\\" with Thales \
himself, pointing out that Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius speaks of a poem, \
probably a satire, where Thales is snatched to heaven by the sun, \\\"Perhaps \
it was an elaborate paronomasia based on the fact that ''thal'' was the \
Phoenician word for dew.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Feldman\\\"/>\\n\\n===Beliefs in \
divinity===\\n{{See also|Neopythagoreanism|Neoplatonism}}\\nThales applied \
his method to objects that changed to become other objects, such as water \
into earth (or so he thought). Thales also applied his method to the act of \
change itself, approaching it through [[lodestone]] and [[amber]] (which, \
when electrified by rubbing together, also attracts).{{citation \
needed|date=August 2017}}  As for the ability of a mover to move something \
else without being changed itself, Thales saw a commonality between that and \
the power of a living thing to act. The lodestone and the amber must be \
alive, and if that were so, there could be no difference between the living \
and the dead. When asked why he didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t die if there was no \
difference, he replied \\\"because there is no difference.\\\"{{citation \
needed|date=August 2017}}\\n\\nAristotle defined the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] \
as the principle of life, that which imbues the matter and makes it live, \
giving it the animation, or power to act. The idea did not originate with \
him, as the Greeks in general believed in the distinction between mind and \
matter, which was ultimately to lead to a distinction not only between body \
and soul but also between matter and energy.{{citation needed|date=August \
2017}}  If things were alive, they must have souls. This belief was no \
innovation, as the ordinary ancient populations of the Mediterranean did \
believe that natural actions were caused by divinities. Accordingly, \
Aristotle and other ancient writers state that Thales believed that \\\"all \
things were full of gods.\\\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Aristotle \

Thales was looking for something more general, a universal substance of \
mind.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} That also was in the polytheism \
of the times. [[Zeus]] was the very personification of supreme [[mind]], \
dominating all the subordinate manifestations. From Thales on, however, \
philosophers had a tendency to depersonify or objectify mind, as though it \
were the substance of animation per se and not actually a god like the other \
gods. The end result was a total removal of mind from substance, opening the \
door to a non-divine principle of action.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\
\\n\\nClassical thought, however, had proceeded only a little way along that \
path. Instead of referring to the person, Zeus, they talked about the great \
mind:\\n\\n{{quote| \\\"Thales\\\", says [[Cicero]],<ref>{{cite book \

posed \\\"the independent pre-existence of God from all eternity, stating \

scarcity of sources concerning Thales and the diversity among the ones we \

the Greek mathematicians that came after him.\\n\\nHistorian Roger L. Cooke \
points out that Proclus does not make any mention of Mesopotamian influence \
on Thales or Greek geometry, but \\\"is shown clearly in Greek astronomy, in \
the use of sexagesimal system of measuring angles and in Ptolemy's explicit \

writing \\\"It follows that we have to abandon the traditional belief that \

historians, such as D. R. Dicks takes issue with the idea that we can \
determine from the questionable sources we have, just how influenced Thales \

been able to calculate an eclipse using a cycle called the \\\"Saros\\\" held \
to have been \\\"borrowed from the Babylonians\\\", \\\"The Babylonians, \
however, did not use cycles to predict solar eclipses, but computed them from \

relates that \\\"No Babylonian theory for predicting solar eclipse existed at \
600&nbsp;B.C., as one can see from the very unsatisfactory situation \
400&nbsp;years later; nor did the Babylonians ever develop any theory which \
took the influence of geographical latitude into account.\\\" Dicks examines \
the cycle referred to as  'Saros' - which Thales is held to have used and \
which is believed to stem from the Babylonians. He points out that Ptolemy \
makes use of this and another cycle in his book ''Mathematical Syntaxis'' but \
attributes it to Greek astronomers earlier than [[Hipparchus]] and not to \
Babylonians.<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/> Dicks notes Herodotus does relate that \
Thales made use of a cycle to predict the eclipse, but maintains that \\\"if \
so, the fulfillment of the 'prediction' was a stroke of pure luck not science\
\\\".<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/> He goes further joining with other historians \
(F. Martini, J.L. E. Dreyer, O. Neugebauer) in rejecting the historicity of \
the eclipse story altogether.<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/> Dicks links the story \
of Thales discovering the cause for a solar eclipse with Herodotus' claim \
that Thales discovered the cycle of the sun with relation to the solstices, \
and concludes \\\"he could not possibly have possessed this knowledge which \
neither the Egyptians nor the Babylonians nor his immediate successors \
possessed.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/> Josephus is the only ancient \
historian that claims Thales visited Babylonia.\\n\\nHerodotus wrote that the \
Greeks learnt the practice of dividing the day into 12 parts, about the \
''polos'', and the [[gnomon]] from the Babylonians. (The exact meaning of his \
use of the word ''polos'' is unknown, current theories include: \\\"the \
heavenly dome\\\", \\\"the tip of the axis of the celestial sphere\\\", or a \
spherical concave sundial.) Yet even Herodotus' claims on Babylonian \
influence are contested by some modern historians, such as L. Zhmud, who \
points out that the division of the day into twelve parts (and by analogy the \
year) was known to the Egyptians already in the second millennium, the gnomon \
was known to both Egyptians and Babylonians, and the idea of the \\\"heavenly \
sphere\\\" was not used outside of Greece at this time.<ref>{{cite book \
|last=Zhmud |first=Leonid |title=The Origin of the History of Science in \
Classical Antiquity |publisher=Die Deutsche Bibliothek \
|year=2006}}</ref>\\n\\nLess controversial than the position that Thales \
learnt Babylonian mathematics is the claim he was influenced by Egyptians. \
Pointedly historian S. N. Bychkov holds that the idea that the base angles of \
an isosceles triangle are equal likely came from Egypt. This is because, when \
building a roof for a home - having a cross section be exactly an isosceles \
triangle isn't crucial (as it's the ridge of the roof that must fit \
precisely), in contrast a symmetric square pyramid cannot have errors in the \
base angles of the faces or they will not fit together tightly.<ref \
name=\\\"Cooke\\\"/>\\nHistorian D.R. Dicks agrees that compared to the \
Greeks in the era of Thales, there was a more advanced state of mathematics \
among the Babylonians and especially the Egyptians - \\\"both cultures knew \
the correct formulae for determining the areas and volumes of simple \
geometrical figures such as triangles, rectangles, trapezoids, etc.; the \
Egyptians could also calculate correctly the volume of the frustum of a \
pyramid with a square base (the Babylonians used an incorrect formula for \
this), and used a formula for the area of a circle...which gives a value for \
[[Pi|\[Pi]]] of 3.1605--a good approximation.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/> \
Dicks also agrees that this would have had an effect on Thales (whom the most \
ancient sources agree was interested in mathematics and astronomy) but he \
holds that tales of Thales' travels in these lands are pure myth.\\n\\nThe \
ancient civilization and massive monuments of Egypt had \\\"a profound and \
ineradicable impression on the Greeks\\\". They attributed to Egyptians \
\\\"an immemorial knowledge of certain subjects\\\" (including geometry) and \
would claim Egyptian origin for some of their own ideas to try and lend them \
\\\"a respectable antiquity\\\" (such as the [[Hermetica|\\\"Hermetic\\\" \
literature]] of the Alexandrian period).<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/>\\n\\nDicks \
holds that since Thales was a prominent figure in Greek history by the time \
of Eudemus but \\\"nothing certain was known except that he lived in \
Miletus\\\".<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/>  A tradition developed that as \
\\\"Milesians were in a position to be able to travel widely\\\" Thales must \
have gone to Egypt.<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/> As Herodotus says Egypt was the \
birthplace of geometry he must have learnt that while there. Since he had to \
have been there, surely one of the theories on Nile Flooding laid out by \
Herodotus must have come from Thales. Likewise as he must have been in Egypt \
he had to have done something with the Pyramids - thus the tale of measuring \
them. Similar apocryphal stories exist of Pythagoras and Plato traveling to \
Egypt with no corroborating evidence.\\n\\nAs the Egyptian and Babylonian \
geometry at the time was \\\"essentially arithmetical\\\", they used actual \
numbers and \\\"the procedure is then described with explicit instructions as \
to what to do with these numbers\\\" there was no mention of how the rules of \
procedure were made, and nothing toward a logically arranged corpus of \
generalized geometrical knowledge with analytical 'proofs' such as we find in \
the words of Euclid, Archimedes, and Apollonius.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/> \
So even had Thales traveled there he could not have learnt anything about the \
theorems he is held to have picked up there (especially because there is no \
evidence that any Greeks of this age could use Egyptian hieroglyphics).<ref \
name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/>\\n\\nLikewise until around the second century BC and the \
time of Hipparchus (c. 194-120&nbsp;BC) the Babylonian general division of \
the circle into 360&nbsp;degrees and their sexagesimal system was \
unknown.<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/>  Herodotus says almost nothing about \
Babylonian literature and science, and very little about their history. Some \
historians, like P. Schnabel, hold that the Greeks only learned more about \
Babylonian culture from Berossus, a Babylonian priest who is said to have set \
up a school in Cos around 270&nbsp;BC (but to what extent this had in the \
field of geometry is contested).\\n\\nDicks points out that the primitive \
state of Greek mathematics and astronomical ideas exhibited by the peculiar \
notions of Thales' successors (such as Anaximander, Anaximenes, Xenophanes, \
and Heraclitus), which historian J. L. Heiberg calls \\\"a mixture of \
brilliant intuition and childlike analogies\\\",<ref>{{cite book |last=Gesch \

organisation of scientific activity will alone explain all the facts. The \
development of doctrine in the hands of ''Thales'', [[Anaximander]], and \
[[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], for instance, can only be understood as \
the elaboration of a single idea in a school with a continuous \
tradition.}}\\n\\n== Interpretations ==\\nIn the long sojourn of philosophy, \
there has existed hardly a philosopher or historian of philosophy who did not \
mention Thales and try to characterize him in some way. He is generally \
recognized as having brought something new to human thought. Mathematics, \
astronomy, and medicine already existed. Thales added something to these \
different collections of knowledge to produce a universality, which, as far \
as writing tells us, was not in tradition before, but resulted in a new \
field.\\n\\nEver since, interested persons have been asking what that new \
something is. Answers fall into (at least) two categories, the theory and the \
method. Once an answer has been arrived at, the next logical step is to ask \
how Thales compares to other philosophers, which leads to his classification \
(rightly or wrongly).\\n\\n===Theory===\\nThe most natural epithets of Thales \
are \\\"[[materialist]]\\\" and \\\"[[naturalism \
(philosophy)|naturalist]]\\\", which are based on ousia and physis. The \
[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] notes that Aristotle called him a physiologist, \
with the meaning \\\"student of nature.\\\"<ref>Turner, ''Catholic \
Encyclopedia''.</ref> On the other hand, he would have qualified as an early \
[[physicist]], as did Aristotle. They studied corpora, \\\"bodies\\\", the \
medieval descendants of substances.\\n\\nMost agree that Thales' stamp on \
thought is the unity of substance, hence [[Bertrand Russell]]:<ref>''Wisdom \
of the West''</ref>\\n\\n{{quote|The view that all matter is one is quite a \
reputable scientific hypothesis.\\n\\n...But it is still a handsome feat to \
have discovered that a substance remains the same in different [[Phase \
(matter)|states of aggregation]].}}\\n\\nRussell was only reflecting an \
established tradition; for example: [[Nietzsche]], in his ''[[Philosophy in \
the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', wrote:<ref>\[Section] \
3</ref>\\n\\n{{quote|Greek philosophy seems to begin with an absurd notion, \
with the proposition that ''water'' is the primal origin and the womb of all \
things. Is it really necessary for us to take serious notice of this \
proposition? It is, and for three reasons. First, because it tells us \
something about the primal origin of all things; second, because it does so \
in language devoid of image or fable, and finally, because contained in it, \
if only embryonically, is the thought, \\\"all things are \
one.\\\"}}\\n\\nThis sort of materialism, however, should not be confused \
with deterministic materialism. Thales was only trying to explain the unity \
observed in the free play of the qualities. The arrival of uncertainty in the \
modern world made possible a return to Thales; for example, [[John Elof \
Boodin]] writes (\\\"God and Creation\\\"):\\n\\n{{quote|We cannot read the \
universe from the past...}}\\n\\nBoodin defines an \\\"emergent\\\" \
materialism, in which the objects of sense emerge uncertainly from the \
substrate. Thales is the innovator of this sort of materialism.\\n\\n===Rise \
of theoretical inquiry===\\nIn the West, Thales represents a new kind of \
inquiring community as well. [[Edmund Husserl]]<ref>''The Vienna \
Lecture''</ref> attempts to capture the new movement as follows. \
Philosophical man is a \\\"new cultural configuration\\\" based in stepping \
back from \\\"pregiven tradition\\\" and taking up a rational \\\"inquiry \
into what is true in itself;\\\" that is, an ideal of truth. It begins with \
isolated individuals such as Thales, but they are supported and cooperated \
with as time goes on. Finally the ideal transforms the norms of society, \
leaping across national borders.\\n\\n===Classification===\\nThe term \
\\\"[[Pre-Socratic]]\\\" derives ultimately from the philosopher Aristotle, \
who distinguished the early philosophers as concerning themselves with \
substance.\\n\\nDiogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius on the other hand took a \
strictly geographic and ethnic approach. Philosophers were either Ionian or \
Italian. He used \\\"Ionian\\\" in a broader sense, including also the \
Athenian academics, who were not Pre-Socratics. From a philosophic point of \
view, any grouping at all would have been just as effective. There is no \
basis for an Ionian or Italian unity. Some scholars, however, concede to \
Diogenes' scheme as far as referring to an \\\"Ionian\\\" school. There was \
no such school in any sense.\\n\\nThe most popular approach refers to a \
Milesian school, which is more justifiable socially and philosophically. They \
sought for the substance of phenomena and may have studied with each other. \
Some ancient writers qualify them as Milesioi, \\\"of \
Miletus.\\\"\\n\\n==Influence on \
others==\\n[[File:Louisstgaudens1.jpg|left|thumb|''Thales (Electricity)'', \
sculpture from \\\"The Progress of Railroading\\\" (1908), main facade of \
[[Union Station (Washington, DC)]]]]\\n\\nThales had a profound influence on \
other Greek thinkers and therefore on [[Western world|Western]] history. Some \
believe [[Anaximander]] was a pupil of Thales. Early sources report that one \
of Anaximander's more famous pupils, [[Pythagoras]], visited Thales as a \
young man, and that Thales advised him to travel to Egypt to further his \
philosophical and mathematical studies.\\n\\nMany philosophers followed \
Thales' lead in searching for explanations in [[nature]] rather than in the \
supernatural; others returned to supernatural explanations, but couched them \
in the language of philosophy rather than of myth or of \
[[religion]].\\n\\nLooking specifically at Thales' influence during the \
pre-Socratic era, it is clear that he stood out as one of the first thinkers \
who thought more in the way of ''[[logos]]'' than ''[[Mythology|mythos]]''. \
The difference between these two more profound ways of seeing the world is \
that ''mythos'' is concentrated around the stories of holy origin, while \
''logos'' is concentrated around the argumentation. When the mythical man \
wants to explain the world the way he sees it, he explains it based on gods \
and powers. Mythical thought does not differentiate between things and \
persons{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and furthermore it does not \
differentiate between nature and culture{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. \
The way a ''logos'' thinker would present a world view is radically different \
from the way of the mythical thinker. In its concrete form, ''logos'' is a \
way of thinking not only about individualism{{Clarify|date=July 2009}}, but \
also the abstract{{Clarify|date=July 2009}}. Furthermore, it focuses on \
sensible and continuous argumentation. This lays the foundation of \
[[philosophy]] and its way of explaining the world in terms of abstract \
argumentation, and not in the way of gods and mythical stories{{Citation \
needed|date=July 2009}}.\\n\\n==Reliability of sources==\\n[[File:Nuremberg \
chronicles f 59r 2.png|thumb|180px|Thales, [[Nuremberg \
Chronicle]].]]\\n\\nBecause of Thales' elevated status in Greek culture an \
intense interest and admiration followed his reputation. Due to this \
following, the oral stories about his life were open to amplification and \
historical fabrication, even before they were written down generations later. \
Most modern dissension comes from trying to interpret what we know, in \
particular, distinguishing legend from fact.\\n\\nHistorian D.R. Dicks and \
other historians divide the ancient sources about Thales into those before \
320&nbsp;BC and those after that year (some such as [[Proclus]] writing in \
the 5th century C.E. and [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] in the 6th century C.E. \
writing nearly a millennium after his era).<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/> The \
first category includes [[Herodotus]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], \
[[Aristophanes]], and [[Theophrastus]] among others. The second category \
includes [[Plautus]], [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]], [[Eusebius]], \
[[Plutarch]], [[Josephus]], [[Iamblichus]], [[Diogenes \
La\[EDoubleDot]rtius]], [[Theon of Smyrna]], [[Apuleius]], [[Clement of \
Alexandria]], [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[John Tzetzes]] among \
others.\\n\\nThe earliest sources on Thales (living before 320&nbsp;BC) are \
often the same for the other [[Milesian school|Milesian philosophers]] \
([[Anaximander]], and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]). These sources \
were either roughly contemporaneous (such as [[Herodotus]]) or lived within a \
few hundred years of his passing. Moreover, they were writing from an oral \
tradition that was widespread and well known in the Greece of their \
day.\\n\\nThe latter sources on Thales are several  \\\"ascriptions of \
commentators and compilers who lived anything from 700 to 1,000&nbsp;years \
after his death\\\"<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/> which include \\\"anecdotes of \
varying degrees of plausibility\\\"<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/> and in the \
opinion of some historians (such as D. R. Dicks) of \\\"no historical worth \
whatsoever\\\".<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/> Dicks points out that there is no \
agreement \\\"among the 'authorities' even on the most fundamental facts of \
his life--e.g. whether he was a Milesian or a Phoenician, whether he left any \
writings or not, whether he was married or single-much less on the actual \
ideas and achievements with which he is credited.\\\"<ref \
name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/>\\n\\nContrasting the work of the more ancient writers \
with those of the later, Dicks points out that in the works of the early \
writers Thales and the other men who would be hailed as \\\"the Seven Sages \
of Greece\\\" had a different reputation than that which would be assigned to \
them by later authors. Closer to their own era, Thales, [[Solon]], [[Bias of \
Priene]], [[Pittacus of Mytilene]] and others were hailed as \\\"essentially \
practical men who played leading roles in the affairs of their respective \
states, and were far better known to the earlier Greeks as lawgivers and \
statesmen than as profound thinkers and philosophers.\\\"<ref \
name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/> For example, Plato praises him (coupled with \
[[Anacharsis]]) for being the originator of the potter's wheel and the \
anchor.\\n\\nOnly in the writings of the second group of writers (working \
after 320&nbsp;BC) do \\\"we obtain the picture of Thales as the pioneer in \
Greek scientific thinking, particularly in regard to mathematics and \
astronomy which he is supposed to have learnt about in Babylonia and Egypt.\\\
\"<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/> Rather than \\\"the earlier tradition [where] he \
is a favourite example of the intelligent man who possesses some technical \
'know how'...the later [[Doxography|doxographers]] [such as [[Dicaearchus]] \
in the latter half of the fourth century BC] foist on to him any number of \
discoveries and achievements, in order to build him up as a figure of \
superhuman wisdom.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/>\\n\\nDicks points out a \
further problem arises in the surviving information on Thales, for rather \
than using ancient sources closer to the era of Thales, the authors in later \
antiquity (\\\"epitomators, excerptors, and compilers\\\"<ref \
name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/>) actually \\\"preferred to use one or more \
intermediaries, so that what we actually read in them comes to us not even at \
second, but at third or fourth or fifth hand. ...Obviously this use of \
intermediate sources, copied and recopied from century to century, with each \
writer adding additional pieces of information of greater or less \
plausibility from his own knowledge, provided a fertile field for errors in \
transmission, wrong ascriptions, and fictitious attributions\\\".<ref name=\\\
\"Dicks\\\"/> Dicks points out that \\\"certain doctrines that later \
commentators invented for Thales...were then accepted into the biographical \
tradition\\\" being copied by subsequent writers who were then cited by those \
coming after them \\\"and thus, because they may be repeated by different \
authors relying on different sources, may produce an illusory impression of \
genuineness.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/>\\n\\nDoubts even exist when \
considering the philosophical positions held to originate in Thales \\\"in \
reality these stem directly from Aristotle's own interpretations which then \
became incorporated in the doxographical tradition as erroneous ascriptions \
to Thales\\\".<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/> (The same treatment was given by \
Aristotle to [[Anaxagoras]].)\\n\\nMost philosophic analyses of the \
philosophy of Thales come from [[Aristotle]], a professional philosopher, \
tutor of [[Alexander the Great]], who wrote 200&nbsp;years after Thales' \
death. Aristotle, judging from his surviving books, does not seem to have \
access to any works by Thales, although he probably had access to works of \
other authors about Thales, such as [[Herodotus]], [[Hecataeus of \
Miletus|Hecataeus]], [[Plato]] etc., as well as others whose work is now \
extinct. It was Aristotle's express goal to present Thales' work not because \
it was significant in itself, but as a prelude to his own work in natural \
philosophy.<ref>See Aristotle, Metaphysics Alpha, 983b 1-27.</ref> [[Geoffrey \
Kirk]] and [[John Raven]], English compilers of the fragments of the \
Pre-Socratics, assert that Aristotle's \\\"judgments are often distorted by \
his view of earlier philosophy as a stumbling progress toward the truth that \
Aristotle himself revealed in his physical doctrines.\\\"<ref>Kirk and Raven, \
The Presocratic Philosophers, Second Edition (Cambridge University Press, \
1983) 3.</ref>  There was also an extensive oral tradition. Both the oral and \
the written were commonly read or known by all educated men in the region.\\n\
\\nAristotle's philosophy had a distinct stamp: it professed the theory of \
matter and form, which modern scholastics have dubbed [[hylomorphism]]. \
Though once very widespread, it was not generally adopted by [[rationalist]] \
and modern science, as it mainly is useful in [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] \
analyses, but does not lend itself to the detail that is of interest to \
modern science. It is not clear that the theory of matter and form existed as \
early as Thales, and if it did, whether Thales espoused it.\\n\\nWhile some \
historians, like B. Snell, maintain that Aristotle was relying on a \
pre-Platonic written record by [[Hippias]] rather than oral tradition, this \
is a controversial position. Representing the scholarly consensus Dicks \
states that \\\"the tradition about him even as early as the fifth century \
B.C., was evidently based entirely on hearsay....It would seem that already \
by Aristotle's time the early Ionians were largely names only to which \
popular tradition attached various ideas or achievements with greater or less \
plausibility\\\".<ref name=\\\"Dicks\\\"/> He points out that works confirmed \
to have existed in the sixth century BC by Anaximander and Xenophanes had \
already disappeared by the fourth century BC, so the chances of Pre-Socratic \
material surviving to the age of Aristotle is almost nil (even less likely \
for Aristotle's pupils Theophrastus and Eudemus and less likely still for \
those following after them).\\n\\nThe main secondary source concerning the \
details of Thales' life and career is [[Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius]], \
\\\"''[[Lives of Eminent Philosophers]]''\\\".<ref>Translation of his \

\\\"Italian\\\", but he places the Academics in the Ionian school and \
otherwise evidences considerable disarray and contradiction, especially in \
the long section on forerunners of the \\\"Ionian School\\\". Diogenes quotes \

in ''[[Chambers's Encyclop\[AE]dia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. \
1, p. 403.</ref> a city of [[Ionia]] (in modern-day Turkey). He belonged to \
the [[Milesian school]] and learned the teachings of his master [[Thales]]. \
He succeeded Thales and became the second master of that school where he \
counted [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] and, arguably, [[Pythagoras]] \
amongst his pupils.<ref>{{cite \

\\n\\nLittle of his life and work is known today. According to available \
historical documents, he is the first philosopher known to have written down \
his studies,<ref>[[Themistius]], ''Oratio'' 36, \[Section]317</ref> although \
only one fragment of his work remains. Fragmentary testimonies found in \
documents after his death provide a portrait of the man.\\n\\nHe was an early \
proponent of [[science]] and tried to observe and explain different aspects \
of the universe, with a particular [[cosmogony|interest in its origins]], \
claiming that nature is ruled by laws, just like human societies, and \
anything that disturbs the balance of nature does not last long.<ref>Park, \
David (2005) ''The Grand Contraption'', Princeton University Press \
{{ISBN|0-691-12133-8}}</ref> Like many thinkers of his time, Anaximander's \
[[philosophy]] included contributions to many disciplines. In [[astronomy]], \
he attempted to describe the mechanics of celestial bodies in relation to the \
Earth. In physics, his postulation that the indefinite (or [[Apeiron \
(cosmology)|apeiron]]) was the source of all things led Greek philosophy to a \
new level of conceptual abstraction. His knowledge of [[geometry]] allowed \
him to introduce the [[gnomon]] in Greece. He created a map of the world that \
contributed greatly to the advancement of [[geography]]. He was also involved \
in the [[politics]] of Miletus and was sent as a leader to one of its \
colonies.\\n\\n==Biography==\\n[[Image:Anaximander.jpg|thumb|left|140px|\

was born in the third year of the 42nd [[Olympiad]] (610 BC).<ref \
name=\\\"Refutation\\\">[[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] (?), ''[[Refutation \
of All Heresies]]'' (I, 5)</ref> According to [[Apollodorus of Athens]], \
Greek grammarian of the 2nd century BC, he was sixty-four years old during \
the second year of the 58th Olympiad (547\[Dash]546&nbsp;BC), and died \
shortly afterwards.<ref>In his ''Chronicles'', as reported by [[Diogenes La\
\[EDoubleDot]rtius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' (II, \
2).</ref>\\n\\nEstablishing a timeline of his work is now impossible, since \
no document provides chronological references. [[Themistius]], a 4th-century \
[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[rhetoric]]ian, mentions that he was the \
\\\"first of the known Greeks to publish a written document on nature.\\\" \
Therefore, his texts would be amongst the earliest written in [[prose]], at \
least in the Western world. By the time of [[Plato]], his philosophy was \
almost forgotten, and [[Aristotle]], his successor [[Theophrastus]] and a few \
[[Doxography|doxographers]] provide us with the little information that \
remains. However, we know from Aristotle that Thales, also from Miletus, \
precedes Anaximander. It is debatable whether Thales actually was the teacher \
of Anaximander, but there is no doubt that Anaximander was influenced by \
Thales' theory that everything is derived from water. One thing that is not \
debatable is that even the ancient Greeks considered Anaximander to be from \
the Monist school which began in Miletus, with Thales followed by Anaximander \
and finished with [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]].<ref>Richard D. \
McKirahan, ''Philosophy before Socrates'', Ch 5, 32\[Dash]34</ref>  \
3rd-century [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rhetorician [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] \
depicts him as leader of the Milesian colony to [[Sozopol|Apollonia]] on the \
[[Black Sea]] coast, and hence some have inferred that he was a prominent \
citizen.<ref \

ref> Indeed, ''Various History'' (III, 17) explains that philosophers \
sometimes also dealt with political matters. It is very likely that leaders \
of Miletus sent him there as a legislator to create a constitution or simply \
to maintain the colony\[CloseCurlyQuote]s allegiance.\\n\\nAnaximander lived \
the final few years of his life as a subject of the [[Achaemenid \
Empire|Persian Achaemenid Empire]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dandamaev|first1=M. \

the period of Achaemenid rule in Miletus, which was the most important city \
of Ionia, there lived the eminent philosopher Anaximander and the geographer \
and historian Hecataeus.}}</ref>\\n\\n==Theories==\\nAnaximander's theories \
were influenced by the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythical]] tradition, and by \
some ideas of [[Thales]]&nbsp;\[Dash] the father of philosophy&nbsp;\[Dash] \
as well as by observations made by older civilizations in the \
East{{Dubious|date=October 2012}} (especially by the Babylonian \
astrologers).<ref>C. Mosse (1984) ''La Grece archaique d' Homere a Eschyle''. \
Edition du Seuil. p236</ref> All these were elaborated rationally. In his \
desire to find some universal principle, he assumed, like traditional \
religion, the existence of a cosmic order; and in elaborating his ideas on \
this he used the old mythical language which ascribed divine control to \
various spheres of reality. This was a common practice for the Greek \
philosophers in a society which saw gods everywhere, therefore they could fit \
their ideas into a tolerably elastic system.<ref>C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The \
Greek experience''. World publishing Company. Cleveland and New York. \
p168,169.</ref>\\n\\nSome scholars see a gap between the existing mythical \
and the new [[rationalism|rational]] way of thought which is the main \
characteristic of the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]] (8th to 6th century \
BC) in the Greek [[city-state]]s.<ref>[[Herbert Ernest Cushman]] claims \
Anaximander has \\\"the first European philosophical conception of god\\\", \
''A beginner's history of philosophy'', Volume 1 pg. 24</ref> This has given \
rise to the phrase \\\"Greek miracle\\\". But if we follow carefully the \
course of Anaximander's ideas, we will notice that there was not such an \
abrupt break as initially appears. The basic elements of nature ([[Water \
(classical element)|water]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Fire \
(classical element)|fire]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]]) which the \
first Greek philosophers believed that constituted the universe represent in \
fact the primordial forces of previous thought. Their collision produced what \
the mythical tradition had called cosmic harmony. In the old \
cosmogonies&nbsp;\[Dash] [[Hesiod]] (8th&nbsp;\[Dash] 7th century&nbsp;BC) \
and [[Pherecydes of Syros|Pherecydes]] (6th century BC)&nbsp;\[Dash] [[Zeus]] \
establishes his order in the world by destroying the powers which were \
threatening this harmony, (the [[Titans (mythology)|Titans]]). Anaximander \
claimed that the cosmic order is not [[monarchic]] but [[geometric]] and this \
causes the equilibrium of the earth which is lying in the centre of the \
universe. This is the projection on nature of a new political order and a new \
space organized around a centre which is the static point of the system in \
the society as in nature.<ref>C. Mosse (1984) ''La Grece archaique d'Homere a \
Eschyle''. Edition du Seuil. p 235</ref> In this space there is ''isonomy'' \
(equal rights) and all the forces are symmetrical and transferrable. The \
decisions are now taken by the assembly of ''[[Glossary of rhetorical \
terms#Demos|demos]]'' in the ''[[agora]]'' which is lying in the middle of \
the city.<ref>J. P. Vernart (1982) ''Les origins de la pensee grecque''. PUF \
Pariw. p 128, J. P. Vernart (1982) ''The origins of the Greek thought''. \
Cornell University Press.</ref>\\n\\nThe same ''rational'' way of thought led \
him to introduce the abstract ''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]'' \
(indefinite, infinite, boundless, \
unlimited<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%\

Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref>) as an \
origin of the universe, a concept that is probably influenced by the original \
[[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]] (gaping void, abyss, formless state) of the \
mythical [[Greece|Greek]] [[cosmogony]] from which everything else \
appeared.<ref>''The Theogony of Hesiod'', Transl. H. G. Evelyn White, 736\
\[Dash]740</ref> It also takes notice of the mutual changes between the four \
elements. Origin, then, must be something else unlimited in its source, that \
could create without experiencing decay, so that genesis would never \
stop.<ref>Aetios, I 3,3 [ [[Pseudo-Plutarch]]; DK 12 A 14.]; Aristotle, \
''Phys.'' \[CapitalGamma]5,204b 23sq. [DK 12 A \

(c. 610 BC\[Dash]c. 322 BC)}}\\n\\nThe ''Refutation'' attributed to \
[[Hippolytus of Rome]] (I, 5), and the later 6th century Byzantine \
philosopher [[Simplicius of Cilicia]], attribute to Anaximander the earliest \
use of the word ''ape\[IAcute]ron'' ({{lang|grc|\:1f04\[Pi]\[CurlyEpsilon]\
\[Iota]\[Rho]\[Omicron]\[Nu]}} \\\"infinite\\\" or \\\"limitless\\\") to \
designate the original principle. He was the first philosopher to employ, in \
a philosophical context, the term ''[[Arche|arch\:1ebf]]'' ({{lang|grc|\:1f00\
\[Rho]\[Chi]\:03ae}}), which until then had meant beginning or origin. For \
him, it became no longer a mere point in time, but a source that could \
perpetually give birth to whatever will be. The indefiniteness is spatial in \
early usages as in [[Homer]] (indefinite sea) and as in [[Xenophanes]] (6th \
century BC) who said that the earth went down indefinitely (to ''apeiron'') \
i.e. beyond the imagination or concept of men.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kirk \

(Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', I III 3\[Dash]4) that the [[Pre-Socratic \
philosophy|Pre-Socratics]] were searching for the element that constitutes \
all things. While each pre-Socratic philosopher gave a different answer as to \
the identity of this element ([[water (classical element)|water]] for Thales \
and [[air (classical element)|air]] for Anaximenes), Anaximander understood \
the beginning or first principle to be an endless, unlimited primordial mass \
(''apeiron''), subject to neither old age nor decay, that perpetually yielded \
fresh materials from which everything we perceive is \
derived.<ref>[[Pseudo-Plutarch]], ''The Doctrines of the Philosophers'' (I, \
3).</ref> He proposed the theory of the ''apeiron'' in direct response to the \
earlier theory of his teacher, Thales, who had claimed that the primary \
substance was water. The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the \
Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious concept of immortality and \
Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This \
''arche'' is called \\\"eternal and ageless\\\". (Hippolytus (?), \
''Refutation'', I,6,I;DK B2)<ref>{{Cite book |last=Guthrie |first=William \

Philosophy|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University \
Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&pg|isbn=978-0-521-29420-1|\
page=83}}</ref>\\n\\nFor Anaximander, the [[Principle (chemistry)|principle]] \
of things, the constituent of all substances, is nothing determined and not \
an element such as water in Thales' view. Neither is it something halfway \
between air and water, or between air and fire, thicker than air and fire, or \
more subtle than water and earth.<ref>[[Aristotle]], ''[[On Generation and \
Corruption]]'' (II, 5)</ref> Anaximander argues that water cannot embrace all \
of the opposites found in nature \[LongDash] for example, water can only be \
wet, never dry \[LongDash] and therefore cannot be the one primary substance; \
nor could any of the other candidates. He postulated the ''apeiron'' as a \
substance that, although not directly perceptible to us, could explain the \
opposites he saw around him.\\n\\nAnaximander explains how the [[Classical \
element|four elements]] of ancient physics ([[air (classical element)|air]], \
[[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[water (classical element)|water]] and \
[[fire (classical element)|fire]]) are formed, and how Earth and terrestrial \
beings are formed through their interactions. Unlike other Pre-Socratics, he \
never defines this principle precisely, and it has generally been understood \
(e.g., by Aristotle and by [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]) as a sort \
of primal [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]. According to him, the Universe \
originates in the separation of opposites in the primordial matter. It \
embraces the opposites of hot and cold, wet and dry, and directs the movement \
of things; an entire host of shapes and differences then grow that are found \
in \\\"all the worlds\\\" (for he believed there were many).<ref \
name=\\\"Chisholm1911\\\"/>\\n\\nAnaximander maintains that all dying things \
are returning to the element from which they came (''apeiron''). The one \
surviving fragment of Anaximander's writing deals with this matter. \
Simplicius transmitted it as a quotation, which describes the balanced and \
mutual changes of the elements:<ref>[[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], \

cosmology-en.svg|thumb|left|280px|Map of Anaximander's \
universe]]\\n\\nAnaximander's bold use of non-[[Greek \
mythology|mythological]] explanatory hypotheses considerably distinguishes \
him from previous cosmology writers such as [[Hesiod]]. It confirms that \
pre-Socratic philosophers were making an early effort to demystify physical \
processes. His major contribution to history was writing the oldest prose \
document about the [[Universe]] and the origins of [[life]]; for this he is \
often called the \\\"Father of [[Cosmology]]\\\" and founder of astronomy. \
However, [[pseudo-Plutarch]] states that he still viewed celestial bodies as \
deities.<ref>Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Doctrines of the Philosophers'', i. \
7</ref>\\n\\nAnaximander was the first to conceive a [[Mechanics|mechanical]] \
model of the [[world]]. In his model, the [[Earth]] floats very still in the \
centre of the infinite, not supported by anything. It remains \\\"in the same \
place because of its indifference\\\", a point of view that Aristotle \
considered ingenious, but false, in ''[[On the Heavens]]''.<ref>Aristotle, \
''On the Heavens'', ii, 13</ref> Its curious shape is that of a [[Cylinder \
(geometry)|cylinder]]<ref>\\\"A column of stone\\\", [[A\[EDoubleDot]tius \
(theologian)|Aetius]] reports in ''De Fide'' (III, 7, 1), or \\\"similar to a \
pillar-shaped stone\\\", pseudo-Plutarch (III, 10).</ref> with a height \
one-third of its diameter. The flat top forms the inhabited world, which is \
surrounded by a circular oceanic mass.\\n\\nAnaximander's realization that \
the Earth floats free without falling and does not need to be resting on \
something has been indicated by many as the first cosmological revolution and \
the starting point of scientific thinking.<ref>Carlo Rovelli, \\\"The First \
Scientist, Anaximander and his Legacy\\\" (Yardley: Westholme, \
2011).</ref><ref>Daniel W. Graham, \\\"Explaining the Cosmos: The Ionian \
Tradition of Scientific Philosophy\\\" (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University \
Press, 2006).</ref> Karl Popper calls this idea \\\"one of the boldest, most \
revolutionary, and most portentous ideas in the whole history of human \
thinking.\\\"<ref>Karl Popper, \\\"Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of \
Scientific Knowledge\\\" (New York: Routledge, 1998), pg 186.</ref>  Such a \
model allowed the concept that [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]] could \
pass under the Earth, opening the way to Greek \
astronomy.\\n\\n[[Image:Persectives of Anaximander's \
universe.png|thumb|right|350px|Illustration of Anaximander's models of the \
universe. On the left, daytime in summer; on the right, nighttime in winter. \
However, Anaximander pictured the earth as a truncated cylinder, not as a \
sphere as shown.]]\\n\\nAt the origin, after the separation of \
[[Temperature|hot and cold]], a ball of flame appeared that surrounded Earth \
like bark on a tree. This ball broke apart to form the rest of the Universe. \
It resembled a system of hollow concentric wheels, filled with fire, with the \
rims pierced by holes like those of a flute. Consequently, the [[Sun]] was \
the fire that one could see through a hole the same size as the Earth on the \
farthest wheel, and an eclipse corresponded with the \
[[Occultation|occlusion]] of that hole. The diameter of the solar wheel was \
twenty-seven times that of the Earth (or twenty-eight, depending on the \
sources)<ref>In ''Refutation'', it is reported that the circle of the Sun is \
twenty-seven times bigger than the Moon.</ref> and the [[Moon|lunar]] wheel, \
whose fire was less intense, eighteen (or nineteen) times. Its hole could \
change shape, thus explaining [[lunar phase]]s. The [[star]]s and the \
[[planet]]s, located closer,<ref>Aetius, ''De Fide'' (II, 15, 6)</ref> \
followed the same model.<ref>Most of Anaximander's model of the Universe \
comes from pseudo-Plutarch (II, 20\[Dash]28):\\n\\n: \\\"[The Sun] is a \
circle twenty-eight times as big as the Earth, with the outline similar to \
that of a fire-filled chariot wheel, on which appears a mouth in certain \
places and through which it exposes its fire, as through the hole on a flute. \
[...] the Sun is equal to the Earth, but the circle on which it breathes and \
on which it's borne is twenty-seven times as big as the whole earth. [...] \
[The eclipse] is when the mouth from which comes the fire heat is closed. \
[...] [The Moon] is a circle nineteen times as big as the whole earth, all \
filled with fire, like that of the Sun\\\".</ref>\\n\\nAnaximander was the \
first astronomer to consider the Sun as a huge mass, and consequently, to \
realize how far from Earth it might be, and the first to present a system \
where the celestial bodies turned at different distances. Furthermore, \
according to Diogenes Laertius (II, 2), he built a [[celestial \
spheres|celestial sphere]]. This invention undoubtedly made him the first to \
realize the [[Axial tilt|obliquity]] of the [[Zodiac]] as the Roman \
philosopher [[Pliny the Elder]] reports in ''[[Natural History \
(Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (II, 8). It is a little early to use the term \
[[ecliptic]], but his knowledge and work on astronomy confirm that he must \
have observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the \
plane of the Earth to explain the seasons. The [[doxography|doxographer]] and \
theologian Aetius attributes to Pythagoras the exact measurement of the \
obliquity.\\n\\n===Multiple worlds===\\nAccording to Simplicius, Anaximander \
already speculated on the [[Cosmic pluralism|plurality of worlds]], similar \
to [[atomism|atomists]] [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]], and later \
philosopher [[Epicurus]]. These thinkers supposed that worlds appeared and \
disappeared for a while, and that some were born when others perished. They \
claimed that this movement was eternal, \\\"for without movement, there can \
be no generation, no destruction\\\".<ref>Simplicius, ''Commentary on \
Aristotle's Physics'', 1121, 5\[Dash]9</ref>\\n\\nIn addition to Simplicius, \
Hippolytus<ref>Hippolytus (?), ''Refutation'' I, 6</ref> reports \
Anaximander's claim that from the infinite comes the principle of beings, \
which themselves come from the heavens and the worlds (several doxographers \
use the plural when this philosopher is referring to the worlds \
within,<ref>Notably pseudo-Plutarch (III, 2) and Aetius, (I, 3, 3; I, 7, 12; \
II, 1, 3; II, 1, 8).</ref> which are often infinite in quantity). [[Cicero]] \
writes that he attributes different gods to the countless worlds.<ref>''On \
the Nature of the Gods'' (I, 10, 25):\\n\\n: ''\\\"Anaximandri autem opinio \
est nativos esse deos longis intervallis orientis occidentisque, eosque \
innumerabiles esse mundos.\\\"''\\n: \\\"For Anaximander, gods were born, but \
the time is long between their birth and their death; and the worlds are \
countless.\\\"</ref>\\n\\nThis theory places Anaximander close to the \
Atomists and the [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] who, more than a century later, \
also claimed that an infinity of worlds appeared and disappeared. In the \
[[Timeline of Western philosophers#Classical philosophers|timeline of the \
Greek history of thought]], some thinkers conceptualized a single world \
(Plato, Aristotle, [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Archelaus (philosopher)|Archelaus]]), \
while others instead speculated on the existence of a series of worlds, \
continuous or non-continuous ([[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], \
[[Heraclitus]], [[Empedocles]] and [[Diogenes \
Apolloniates|Diogenes]]).\\n\\n===Meteorological phenomena===\\nAnaximander \
attributed some phenomena, such as [[thunder]] and [[lightning]], to the \
intervention of elements, rather than to divine causes.<ref>Pseudo-Plutarch \
(III, 3):\\n\\n: \\\"Anaximander claims that all this is done by the wind, \
for when it happens to be enclosed in a thick cloud, then by its subtlety and \
lightness, the rupture produces the sound; and the scattering, because of the \
darkness of the cloud, creates the light.\\\"</ref> In his system, thunder \
results from the shock of clouds hitting each other; the loudness of the \
sound is proportionate with that of the shock. Thunder without lightning is \
the result of the wind being too weak to emit any flame, but strong enough to \
produce a sound. A flash of lightning without thunder is a jolt of the air \
that disperses and falls, allowing a less active fire to break free. \
Thunderbolts are the result of a thicker and more violent air \
flow.<ref>According to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Naturales \
quaestiones'' (II, 18).</ref>\\n\\nHe saw the sea as a remnant of the mass of \
humidity that once surrounded Earth.<ref>Pseudo-Plutarch (III, 16)</ref> A \
part of that mass evaporated under the sun's action, thus causing the winds \
and even the rotation of the celestial bodies, which he believed were \
attracted to places where water is more abundant.<ref>It is then very likely \
that by observing the moon and the tides, Anaximander thought the latter were \
the cause, and not the effect of the satellite's movement.</ref> He explained \
rain as a product of the humidity pumped up from Earth by the sun.<ref \
name=\\\"Refutation\\\" /> For him, the Earth was slowly drying up and water \
only remained in the deepest regions, which someday would go dry as well. \
According to Aristotle's ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'' (II, 3), \
Democritus also shared this opinion.\\n\\n===Origin of \
humankind===\\nAnaximander speculated about the beginnings and \
[[Evolution|origin]] of animal life. Taking into account the existence of \
fossils {{Dubious|date=December 2015}}, he claimed that animals sprang out of \
the sea long ago. The first animals were born trapped in a spiny bark, but as \
they got older, the bark would dry up and break.<ref>Pseudo-Plutarch (V, \
19)</ref> As the early humidity evaporated, dry land emerged and, in time, \
humankind had to adapt. The 3rd century Roman writer [[Censorinus]] \
reports:\\n\\n{{quote|text=Anaximander of Miletus considered that from warmed \
up water and earth emerged either fish or entirely fishlike animals. Inside \
these animals, men took form and embryos were held prisoners until puberty; \
only then, after these animals burst open, could men and women come out, now \
able to feed themselves.<ref>Censorinus, ''De Die Natali'', IV, \
7</ref>|sign=|source=}}\\n\\nAnaximander put forward the idea that humans had \
to spend part of this transition inside the mouths of big fish to protect \
themselves from the Earth's climate until they could come out in open air and \
lose their scales.<ref>[[Plutarch]] also mentions Anaximander's theory that \
humans were born inside fish, feeding like sharks, and that when they could \
defend themselves, they were thrown ashore to live on dry land.</ref> He \
thought that, considering humans' extended infancy, we could not have \
survived in the primeval world in the same manner we do \
presently.\\n\\n==Other \
accomplishments==\\n\\n===Cartography===\\n[[Image:Anaximander world \
map-en.svg|thumb|right|280px|Possible rendering of Anaximander's world \
map<ref>According to John Mansley Robinson, ''An Introduction to Early Greek \
Philosophy'', Houghton and Mifflin, 1968.</ref>]]\\n\\nBoth [[Strabo]] and \
[[Agathemerus]] (later Greek geographers) claim that, according to the \
geographer [[Eratosthenes]], Anaximander was the first to publish a map of \
the world. The map probably inspired the Greek historian [[Hecataeus of \
Miletus]] to draw a more accurate version. Strabo viewed both as the first \
geographers after [[Homer]].\\n\\nMaps were produced in ancient times, also \
notably in [[Egypt]], [[Lydia]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Babylon]]. Only \
some small examples survived until today. The unique example of a world map \
comes from late Babylonian tablet [[Babylonian Map of the World|BM 92687]] \
later than 9th century BC but is based probably on a much older map. These \
maps indicated directions, roads, towns, borders, and geological features. \
Anaximander's innovation was to represent the entire inhabited land known to \
the ancient Greeks.\\n\\nSuch an accomplishment is more significant than it \
at first appears. Anaximander most likely drew this map for three \
reasons.<ref>As established by Marcel Conche, ''Anaximandre. Fragments et t\
\[EAcute]moignages'', introduction (p.&nbsp;43\[Dash]47).</ref> First, it \
could be used to improve navigation and trade between [[Miletus]]'s colonies \
and other colonies around the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. Second, \
[[Thales]] would probably have found it easier to convince the Ionian \
[[Polis|city-states]] to join in a federation in order to push the \
[[Medes|Median]] threat away if he possessed such a tool. Finally, the \
philosophical idea of a global representation of the world simply for the \
sake of knowledge was reason enough to design one.\\n\\nSurely aware of the \
sea's convexity, he may have designed his map on a slightly rounded metal \
surface. The centre or \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]navel\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
of the world ({{lang|grc|\:1f40\[Mu]\[CurlyPhi]\[Alpha]\[Lambda]\:03cc\
\[FinalSigma] \[Gamma]\:1fc6\[FinalSigma]}} ''omphal\[OAcute]s g\:1ebds'') \
could have been [[Delphi]], but is more likely in Anaximander's time to have \
been located near Miletus. The [[Aegean Sea]] was near the map's centre and \
enclosed by three continents, themselves located in the middle of the ocean \
and isolated like islands by sea and rivers. [[Europe]] was bordered on the \
south by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and was separated from [[Asia]] by the \
Black Sea, the [[Sea of Azov|Lake Maeotis]], and, further east, either by the \
[[Rioni River|Phasis River]] (now called the Rioni) or the [[Tanais]]. The \
[[Nile]] flowed south into the ocean, separating [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] \
(which was the name for the part of the then-known [[Africa]]n continent) \
from Asia.\\n\\n===Gnomon===\\nThe ''[[Suda]]'' relates that Anaximander \
explained some basic notions of geometry. It also mentions his interest in \
the measurement of time and associates him with the introduction in \
[[Greece]] of the gnomon. In [[Lacedaemon]], he participated in the \
construction, or at least in the adjustment, of [[sundial]]s to indicate \
[[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es.<ref>These accomplishments are often \
attributed to him, notably by Diogenes Laertius (II, 1) and by the Roman \
historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], ''[[Preparation for the Gospel]]'' (X, \
14, 11).</ref> Indeed, a gnomon required adjustments from a place to another \
because of the difference in latitude.\\n\\nIn his time, the gnomon was \
simply a vertical pillar or rod mounted on a horizontal plane. The position \
of its shadow on the plane indicated the time of day. As it moves through its \
apparent course, the sun draws a curve with the tip of the projected shadow, \
which is shortest at noon, when pointing due south. The variation in the tip\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s position at noon indicates the solar time and the \
seasons; the shadow is longest on the winter solstice and shortest on the \
summer solstice.\\n\\nThe invention of the gnomon itself cannot be attributed \
to Anaximander because its use, as well as the division of days into twelve \
parts, came from the [[Babylonia]]ns. It is they, according to [[Herodotus]]' \
[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] (II, 109), who gave the Greeks the art of \
time measurement. It is likely that he was not the first to determine the \
solstices, because no calculation is necessary. On the other hand, equinoxes \
do not correspond to the middle point between the positions during solstices, \
as the Babylonians thought. As the ''Suda'' seems to suggest, it is very \
likely that with his knowledge of geometry, he became the first Greek to \
accurately determine the equinoxes.\\n\\n===Prediction of an \
earthquake===\\nIn his philosophical work [[De Divinatione]] (I, 50, 112), \
Cicero states that Anaximander convinced the inhabitants of [[Lacedaemon]] to \
abandon their city and spend the night in the country with their weapons \
because an earthquake was \
near.<ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/divinatione1.shtml ''Da \
Divinatione'' (in Latin)]</ref> The city collapsed when the top of the \
[[Taygetus]] split like the stern of a ship. Pliny the Elder also mentions \
this anecdote (II, 81), suggesting that it came from an \\\"admirable \
inspiration\\\", as opposed to Cicero, who did not associate the prediction \
with divination.\\n\\n==Interpretations==\\n[[Bertrand Russell]] in the \
''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]'' \
interprets Anaximander's theories as <!-- the above quote as | CLARIFY: \
probably due to editing, the quote referenced here is unclear. --> an \
assertion of the necessity of an appropriate balance between earth, fire, and \
water, all of which may be independently seeking to aggrandize their \
proportions relative to the others. Anaximander seems to express his belief \
that a natural order ensures balance between these elements, that where there \
was fire, ashes (earth) now exist.<ref>Bertrand Russell, ''A History of \
Western Philosophy and Its Connection with Political and Social Circumstances \
from the Earliest Times to the Present Day'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, \
1946).</ref> His Greek peers echoed this sentiment with their belief in \
natural boundaries beyond which not even the gods could \
operate.\\n\\n[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of \
the Greeks]]'', claimed that Anaximander was a pessimist who asserted that \
the primal being of the world was a state of indefiniteness. In accordance \
with this, anything definite has to eventually pass back into indefiniteness. \
In other words, Anaximander viewed \\\"...all coming-to-be as though it were \
an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which \
destruction is the only penance\\\". (''Ibid.'', \[Section] 4) The world of \
individual objects, in this way of thinking, has no worth and should \
perish.<ref>Friedrich Nietzsche, ''Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the \
Greeks'' (Washington, D.C.: Regnery Gateway, 1962).</ref>\\n\\n[[Martin \
Heidegger]] lectured extensively on Anaximander, and delivered a lecture \
entitled \\\"Anaximander's Saying\\\" which was subsequently included in \
''Off the Beaten Track''. The lecture examines the ontological difference and \
the oblivion of Being or ''[[Dasein]]'' in the context of the Anaximander \
fragment.<ref>Martin Heidegger, ''Off the Beaten Track'' (Cambridge & New \
York: Cambridge University Press, 2002).</ref> Heidegger's lecture is, in \
turn, an important influence on the French philosopher [[Jacques \
Derrida]].<ref>Cf. Jacques Derrida, ''Margins of Philosophy'' (Chicago: \
University of Chicago Press, 1982), pp. 66\[Dash]7; Derrida, \
\\\"''Geschlecht'' II: Heidegger's Hand,\\\" in [[John Sallis]] (ed.), \
''Deconstruction and Philosophy'' (Chicago & London: University of Chicago \
Press, 1987), pp. 181\[Dash]2; Derrida, ''Given Time: I. Counterfeit Money'' \
(Chicago & London: University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 159, n. \
28.</ref>\\n\\n==Works==\\nAccording to the ''Suda'':<ref>Themistius and \
Simplicius also mention some work \\\"on nature\\\". The list could refer to \
book titles or simply their topics. Again, no one can tell because there is \
no punctuation sign in Ancient Greek. Furthermore, this list is incomplete \

Dharmas\:016btra''''' is a Sanskrit text and one of the oldest \
[[Dharma]]-related texts of [[Hinduism]] that have survived into the modern \
age from the 1st-millennium BCE.{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle|2006|p=178 with note \
28}} It is one of three extant [[Dharmasutras]] texts from the Taittiriya \
school of [[Yajurveda|Krishna Yajurveda]], the other two being ''Baudhayana \
Dharmasutra'' and ''Hiranyakesin Dharmasutra''.{{Sfn|Robert \

''Apastamba Grihyasutra''.{{Sfn|Robert Lingat|1973|p=20}} It is one of the \
best preserved ancient texts on Dharma.{{Sfn|Patrick \

broad minded and liberal views on women and all social classes.{{sfn|Patrick \
Olivelle|2006|p=180}} It is also notable for mentioning and citing views of \
ten ancient experts on Dharma, which has led scholars to conclude that there \
existed a rich genre of Dharmasutras text in ancient India before this text \
was composed.{{Sfn|Robert Lingat|1973|pp=19-22, Quote: The dharma-sutra of \

Dharmasutra is attributed to Apastamba, the founder of a [[Shakha]] (Vedic \
school) of [[Yajurveda]].{{Sfn|Robert Lingat|1973|p=20}} According to the \
Hindu tradition, Apastamba was the student of Baudhayana, and himself had a \
student named Hiranyakesin. Each of the three founded a Vedic school, and \
each of their schools produced a collection of literature within the Krishna \
Yajurveda tradition, one that included separate [[Kalpa \
(Vedanga)|Kalpasutra]] compilations.{{Sfn|Robert Lingat|1973|p=20}} They were \
founders of their traditions, but it is unclear if they authored the \
Dharmasutras. It is, states Patrick Olivelle, possible that the Apastamba \
Dharmasutra is ascribed to Apastamba, but actually composed by others in his \
school.{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle|1999|p=xxv-xxvi}}\\n\\nThe Apastamba tradition \
may be from south India, possibly near where modern [[Andhra Pradesh]] is \
between Godavari and Krishna rivers, but this is not certain.{{Sfn|Patrick \
Olivelle|1999|p=xxvii}}{{Sfn|Robert Lingat|1973|pp=21-22}} The verse 2.17.17 \
of the Apastamba Dharmasutra mentions a practice of \\\"northerners\\\" but \
it in unclear what \\\"north\\\" means in the context it is \
used.{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle|1999|p=xxvii}} Further, the ancient grammarian \
[[P\[ABar]\:1e47ini|Panini]] refers to it too, who is generally placed in \
northwest Indian subcontinent.{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle|1999|p=xxvii}} Olivelle \
states that the three Taittiriya school Dharmasutras mention practices of \
north and south, but never clarify how far north or south they are referring \
to, but placing Dharmasutras in the southern Indian peninsula implies that \
Brahmanical ideas had established themselves or emerged in the south by the \
1st millennium BCE.{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle|1999|p=xxvii}} According to \
Olivelle, the Yajurveda schools may have been in what is north India today, \
and the Apastamba Dharmasutra may have been composed in north India, rather \
than south.{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle|1999|p=xxvii-xxviii}} In contrast, Robert \
Lingat states that epigraphical evidence such as the Pallava inscriptions \
confirm that Apastamba tradition existed in South India, in ancient times, in \
parts of what became [[Madras Presidency]] in the colonial British \
India.{{Sfn|Robert Lingat|1973|p=22}}\\n\\nKane estimated that Apastamba \
Dharmasutra dates from approximately 600-300 BCE,{{Sfn|Robert \
Lingat|1973|p=22}} and later more narrowly to between 450-350 \
BCE.{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle|1999|p=xxxi}} Lingat states that the internal \
evidence within the text hints of great antiquity, because unlike later \
Dharma texts, it makes no mention of Buddhism.{{Sfn|Robert Lingat|1973|p=22}} \
Other scholars, such as Hopkins, assert that all this can be explained to be \
an artifact of its relatively remote geographical origins in Andhra region, \
where refined Sanskrit grammar and Buddhist ideas may have reached much \
later, and he places the text to the 2nd-century BCE.{{Sfn|Robert \
Lingat|1973|p=22}} Olivelle, and several other scholars, in contrast, state \
that the first version of Apastamba Dharmasutra may have been composed after \
others, but the extant version of the Apastamba text is the oldest Dharma \
text from ancient India.{{sfn|Patrick Olivelle|1999|p=xxviii with note 8, \
xxx-xxxi with note 10}}{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle|2006|pp=178 wiith note 28, \
186}}\\n\\nRegardless of the relative chronology, the ancient Apastamba \
Dharmasutra, states Olivelle, shows clear signs of a maturing legal procedure \
tradition and that there were Dharma texts in ancient India before it was \
composed.{{sfn|Patrick Olivelle|2005|p=44}}{{Sfn|Robert Lingat|1973|pp=19-22, \
Quote: The dharma-sutra of Apastamba suggests that a rich literature on \
dharma already existed. He cites ten authors by name. (...).}}{{Sfn|Timothy \
Lubin|Donald R. Davis Jr|Jayanth K. Krishnan|2010|p=38}}\\n\\n==Organization \
and content==\\nThe text is in sutra format, and part of thirty ''prashnas'' \
(\:092a\:094d\:0930\:0936\:094d\:0928, portions, issue, questions) of \
Apastamba Kalpasutra.{{Sfn|Robert Lingat|1973|p=21}} The Apastamba \
Dharmasutra is the 28th and 29th ''prashna'' of this compilation,{{Sfn|Robert \
Lingat|1973|p=21}} while the first 24 ''prashnas'' are about Shrautasutras \
(vedic rituals), 25th is an ancillary mantra section, 26th and 27th are \
Grihyasutras (householder rites of passage), and the last or the 30th \
''prashna'' is a Shulbasutra (mathematics for altar building).{{Sfn|Robert \
Lingat|1973|p=21}}{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle|1999|p=3}} The text is \
systematically arranged, cross references to other sections of the Kalpasutra \
compilation so extensively and accurately, as if it is the work of a single \
author.{{Sfn|Robert Lingat|1973|pp=21-22}}\\n\\nOf the two books of this \
Dharmas\:016btra, the first is devoted to the student tradition and the \
second book is devoted to the householder tradition.{{Sfn|Patrick \

Dharmasutra'' is notable for placing the importance of the Veda scriptures \
second and that of ''samayacarika'' or mutually agreed and accepted customs \
of practice first.{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle|1999 |pages=xl}} \
\[CapitalABar]pastamba proposes that scriptures alone cannot be source of Law \
(dharma), and dharma has an empirical nature.{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle |1999 \
|pages=xl}} \[CapitalABar]pastamba asserts that it is difficult to find \
absolute sources of law, in ancient books or current people, according to \
[[Patrick Olivelle]], with \\\"The Righteous (dharma) and the Unrighteous \
(adharma) do not go around saying, 'here we are!'; Nor do gods, Gandharvas or \
ancestors declare, 'This is righteous and that is \
unrighteous'.\\\"{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle |1999 |pages=xl}}\\n\\nMost laws are \
based on agreement between the Aryas, states \[CapitalABar]pastamba, on what \
is right and what is wrong.{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle |1999 |pages=xl}} Laws must \
also change with ages, states \[CapitalABar]pastamba, a theory that became \
known as ''Yuga dharma'' in Hindu traditions.{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle |1999 \
|pages=xli}} \[CapitalABar]pastamba also asserts in verses 2.29.11-15 a broad \
minded and liberal view, states Olivelle, that \\\"aspects of dharma not \
taught in Dharmasastras can be learned from women and people of all classes\\\
\".{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle |2006|p=180}} The Apastamba Dharmasutra also \
recognizes property rights of women, and her ability to inherit wealth from \
her parents.<ref>{{cite book|author=Laurie Patton |title=Jewels of Authority: \

assert that the Vedas once contained all knowledge including that of ideal \
Dharma, but parts of Vedas have been lost.{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle |1999 \
|pages=xli}} Human customs developed from the original complete Vedas, but \
given the lost text, one must use customs between good people as a source to \
infer what the original Vedas might have stated the Dharma to \
be.{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle |1999 |pages=xli}} This theory, called the \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]lost Veda\[CloseCurlyQuote] theory, made the study of \
customs of good people as a source of dharma and guide to proper living, \
states Olivelle.{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle |1999 \

fixed exactly, but assuming the approximate correctness of the statement of \
Aristoxenus (ap. Porph. ''V.P.'' 9) that he left Samos to escape the tyranny \
of Polycrates at the age of forty, we may put his birth round about 570 BC, \
or a few years earlier. The length of his life was variously estimated in \
antiquity, but it is agreed that he lived to a fairly ripe old age, and most \
probably he died at about seventy-five or eighty.\\\" [[William Keith \

Pythagoras.html Biographies]</ref> was an [[Ionians|Ionian]] [[Ancient \
Greeks|Greek]] [[Greek philosophy|philosopher]] and the eponymous founder of \
the [[Pythagoreanism]] movement. His political and religious teachings were \
well-known in [[Magna Graecia]] and influenced the philosophies of [[Plato]], \
[[Aristotle]], and, through them, [[Western philosophy]]. Knowledge of \
Pythagoras's life is largely clouded by legend and [[obfuscation]], but he \
appears to have been the son of Mnesarchus, a [[Seal carving|seal engraver]] \
on the island of [[Samos]]. Modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras's \
education and influences, but they do agree that, in around 530 BC, he \
travelled to [[Crotone|Croton]], where he founded a school in which initiates \
were sworn to secrecy and lived a [[Communalism|communal]], \
[[asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle. Following Croton's decisive victory over \
[[Sybaris]] in around 510 BC, Pythagoras's followers came into conflict with \
supporters of [[Greek democracy|democracy]] and Pythagorean meeting houses \
were burned. Pythagoras may have been killed during this persecution, or he \
may have escaped to [[Metapontum]], where he eventually died.\\n\\nThe \
teaching most securely identified with Pythagoras is ''[[metempsychosis]]'', \
or the \\\"transmigration of souls\\\", which holds that every [[soul]] is \
[[immortality|immortal]] and, upon death, [[reincarnation|enters into a new \
body]]. He may have also devised the doctrine of ''[[musica universalis]]'', \
which holds that the [[Classical planet|planets]] move according to \
[[mathematics|mathematical]] [[equation]]s and thus resonate to produce an \
inaudible [[symphony]] of music. Scholars debate whether Pythagoras himself \
developed the [[Numerology|numerological]] and musical teachings attributed \
to him, or if those teachings were developed by his later followers, \
particularly [[Philolaus|Philolaus of Croton]]. He probably prohibited his \
followers from eating [[bean]]s, but he may or may not have advocated a \
strictly [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] diet.\\n\\nIn antiquity, Pythagoras was \
credited with many mathematical and scientific discoveries, including the \
[[Pythagorean theorem]], [[Pythagorean tuning]], the [[Platonic solids|five \
regular solids]], the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|Theory of \
Proportions]], the [[Spherical Earth|sphericity of the Earth]], and the \
identity of the [[Phosphorus (morning star)|morning]] and [[Hesperus|evening \
stars]] as the planet [[Venus]]. It was said that he was the first man to \
call himself a philosopher (\\\"lover of wisdom\\\"){{efn|[[Cicero]], \
''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', 5.3.8\[Dash]9 (citing [[Heraclides Ponticus]] \
fr. 88 Wehrli), [[Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius]] 1.12, 8.8, [[Iamblichus]] \
''VP'' 58.  Burkert attempted to discredit this ancient tradition, but it has \
been defended by C.J. De Vogel, ''Pythagoras and Early Pythagoreanism'' \
(1966), pp. 97\[Dash]102, and C. Riedweg, ''Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching, \
And Influence'' (2005), p. 92.}} and that he was the first to divide the \
globe into [[Geographical zone|five climatic zones]]. Classical historians \
debate whether Pythagoras made these discoveries, and many of the \
accomplishments credited to him likely originated earlier or were made by his \
colleagues or successors. Some accounts mention that the philosophy \
associated with Pythagoras was related to mathematics and that numbers were \
important, but it is debated to what extent, if at all, he actually \
contributed to mathematics or [[natural philosophy]].\\n\\nPythagoras \
influenced Plato, whose [[Socratic dialogue|dialogues]], especially his \
''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', exhibit Pythagorean teachings. \
Pythagorean ideas about mathematical perfection also impacted [[ancient Greek \
art]]. His teachings underwent a major revival in the first century BC among \
[[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonists]], coinciding with the rise of \
[[Neopythagoreanism]]. Pythagoras continued to be regarded as a great \
philosopher throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and his philosophy had a major \
impact on scientists such as [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler]], \
and [[Isaac Newton]]. Pythagorean symbolism was used throughout early modern \
[[Western esotericism|European esotericism]] and his teachings as portrayed \
in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' influenced the growth of the \
[[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] movement.\\n\\n==Biographical \

(the [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]) represented the origin of all \

number three was an \\\"ideal number\\\" because it had a beginning, middle, \
and end{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=170\[Dash]172}} and was the smallest \
number of points that could be used to define a plane triangle, which they \
revered as a symbol of the god [[Apollo]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=170\
\[Dash]172}} The number four signified the [[Seasons|four seasons]] and the \
[[Classical element|four elements]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=172}} The \
number seven was also sacred because it was the number of planets and the \

Apollo's birthday was celebrated on the seventh day of each \
month.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=172}} They believed that [[Parity \

that even numbers were [[feminine]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=433}} and that \

nTen was regarded as the \\\"perfect number\\\"{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=467\
\[Dash]468}} and the Pythagoreans honored it by never gathering in groups \
larger than ten.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=161}} Pythagoras was credited \
with devising the [[tetractys]], the triangular figure of four rows which add \
up to the perfect number, ten.{{sfn|Bruhn|2005|pages=65\[Dash]66}} The \
Pythagoreans regarded the tetractys as a symbol of utmost mystical \
importance.{{sfn|Bruhn|2005|pages=65\[Dash]66}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=29}} \
Iamblichus, in his ''Life of Pythagoras'', states that the tetractys was \

Croton]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=87\[Dash]88}} In his landmark study \
''Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism'', Walter Burkert argues that \
Pythagoras was a charismatic political and religious \
teacher,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=2\[Dash]3}} but that the number philosophy \
attributed to him was really an innovation by \
Philolaus.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=3}} According to Burkert, Pythagoras never \
dealt with numbers at all, let alone made any noteworthy contribution to \
mathematics.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=2\[Dash]3}} Burkert argues that the only \
mathematics the Pythagoreans ever actually engaged in was simple, \
[[Mathematical proof|proofless]] [[arithmetic]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=428\

pagan alternative to the Christian monastic communities of his own \
time.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=31}}\\n\\nPythagorean teachings were known as \\\
\"symbols\\\" (''symbolon''){{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=8}} and members took a vow \

been given credit for discovering the [[Pythagorean \
theorem]],{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=32\[Dash]33}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=26\
\[Dash]27}} a theorem in geometry that states that \\\"in a right-angled \

the two other sides\\\"{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}\[LongDash]that is, \

discovered this theorem, Pythagoras sacrificed an ox, or possibly even a \
whole ''[[hecatomb]]'', to the \
gods.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=428}} Cicero \
rejected this story as spurious{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}} because of the \
much more widely held belief that Pythagoras forbade blood \
sacrifices.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}} Porphyry attempted to explain the \
story by asserting that the ox was actually made of \
[[dough]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}\\n\\nThe Pythagorean theorem was known \
and used by the [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]] and [[Indian \
mathematics|Indians]] centuries before \
Pythagoras,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=429, \
462}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=32}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|\

music===\\n[[File:Gaffurio Pythagoras.png|thumb|Medieval woodcut showing \
Pythagoras with bells and other instruments in Pythagorean tuning]]\\n{{See \
also|Pythagorean tuning |Pythagorean hammers}} \\nAccording to legend, \
Pythagoras discovered that musical notes could be translated into \
mathematical equations when he passed blacksmiths at work one \
day{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=27\[Dash]28}} and heard the sound of their \
[[Pythagorean hammers|hammers]] clanging against the \
anvils.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=27\[Dash]28}} Thinking that the sounds of the \
hammers were beautiful and harmonious, except for \
one,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}} he rushed into the [[blacksmith]] shop and \
began testing the hammers.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}} He then realized that \
the tune played when the hammer struck was directly proportional to the size \
of the hammer{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}} and therefore concluded that music \
was mathematical.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}} However, this legend is \
demonstrably \
false,{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=143}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=29}} as these \
ratios are only relevant to string length (such as the string of a \
[[monochord]]), and not to hammer weight.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=143}}\\n\
\\n===In astronomy===\\nIn ancient times, Pythagoras and his contemporary \
[[Parmenides|Parmenides of Elea]] were both credited with having been the \
first to teach that the [[Spherical Earth|Earth was \
spherical]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=306}} the first to divide the globe into \
[[Geographical zone|five climactic zones]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=306}} and \

[[Hesperus|evening star]] as the [[Venus|same celestial \
object]].{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=307\[Dash]308}} Of the two philosophers, \
Parmenides has a much stronger claim to having been the \
first{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=306\[Dash]308}} and the attribution of these \
discoveries to Pythagoras seems to have possibly originated from a \
[[pseudepigrapha]]l poem.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=307\[Dash]308}} Empedocles, \
who lived in Magna Graecia shortly after Pythagoras and Parmenides, knew that \
the earth was spherical.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=53}} By the end of the fifth \

According to Charles H. Kahn, Plato's middle dialogues, including \
''[[Meno]]'', ''[[Phaedo]]'', and ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', have \
a strong \\\"Pythagorean coloring\\\",{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=55}} and his last \
few dialogues (particularly ''[[Philebus]]'' and ''[[Timaeus \

based on the \\\"tightly organised community of like-minded thinkers\\\" \
established by Pythagoras at Croton.{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117\[Dash]119}} \
Additionally, Plato may have taken from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics \

substantial theses in [[science]] and \
[[morals]]\\\".{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117\[Dash]119}} Plato and Pythagoras \

philosophy [[Frederick Copleston]] states that Plato probably borrowed \
[[Plato's tripartite theory of soul|his tripartite theory of the soul]] from \
the Pythagoreans.{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=37}} [[Bertrand Russell]], in his \
''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'', contends that the influence of \
Pythagoras on Plato and others was so great that he should be considered the \
most influential philosopher of all \
time.{{sfn|Russell|2008|pages=33\[Dash]37}} He concludes that \\\"I do not \
know of any other man who has been as influential as he was in the school of \
thought.\\\"{{sfn|Russell|2008|page=37}}\\n\\nA revival of Pythagorean \
teachings occurred in the first century \
BC{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=123\[Dash]124}} when [[Middle Platonism|Middle \

[[Neopythagoreanism]] became \
prominent.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=125\[Dash]126}} The first-century AD \
philosopher [[Apollonius of Tyana]] sought to emulate Pythagoras and live by \
Pythagorean teachings.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=125}} The later first-century \
Neopythagorean philosopher [[Moderatus of Gades]] expanded on Pythagorean \
number philosophy{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=125}} and probably understood the \
soul as a \\\"kind of mathematical harmony.\\\"{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=125}} \

Pythagoras,{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}} the sculptor \
[[Polykleitos]] writes in his ''Canon'' that beauty consists in the \
proportion, not of the elements (materials), but of the interrelation of \

portal at [[Chartres \
Cathedral]].{{sfn|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|page=798}}]]\\n\\nDuring the \
[[Middle Ages]], Pythagoras was revered as the founder of mathematics and \
music, two of the [[Seven Liberal \
Arts]].{{sfn|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|page=798}} He appears in numerous \
medieval depictions, in illuminated manuscripts and in the relief sculptures \
on the portal of the [[Cathedral of \
Chartres]].{{sfn|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|page=798}} The ''Timaeus'' was the \
only dialogue of Plato to survive in Latin translation in western \
Europe,{{sfn|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|page=798}} which led [[William of \
Conches]] (c. 1080-1160) to declare that Plato was \
Pythagorean.{{sfn|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|page=798}} In the 1430s, the \
Camaldolese friar [[Ambrose Traversari]] translated Diogenes \
La\[EDoubleDot]rtius's ''Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers'' from \
Greek into Latin{{sfn|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|page=798}} and, in the 1460s, \
the philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] translated Porphyry and Iamblichus's \
''Lives of Pythagoras'' into Latin as \
well,{{sfn|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|page=798}} thereby allowing them to be \
read and studied by western \
scholars.{{sfn|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|page=798}} In 1494, the Greek \
Neopythagorean scholar [[Constantine Lascaris]] published ''[[The Golden \
Verses of Pythagoras]]'', translated into Latin, with a printed edition of \
his ''Grammatica'',{{sfn|Russo|2004|pages=5\[Dash]87, especially \
51\[Dash]53}} thereby bringing them to a widespread \
audience.{{sfn|Russo|2004|pages=5\[Dash]87, especially 51\[Dash]53}} In 1499, \
he published the first Renaissance biography of Pythagoras in his work \
''Vitae illustrium philosophorum siculorum et calabrorum'', issued in \
[[Messina]].{{sfn|Russo|2004|pages=5\[Dash]87, especially \
51\[Dash]53}}\\n\\n===On modern science===\\nIn his preface to his book \
''[[On the Revolution of the Heavenly Spheres]]'' (1543), [[Nicolaus \
Copernicus]] cites various Pythagoreans as the most important influences on \
the development of his [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the \
universe,{{sfn|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|page=798}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=160}} \
deliberately omitting mention of [[Aristarchus of Samos]], a non-Pythagorean \
astronomer who had developed a fully heliocentric model in the fourth century \
BC, in effort to portray his model as fundamentally \
Pythagorean.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=160}} [[Johannes Kepler]] considered himself \
to be a Pythagorean.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=161\[Dash]171}}{{sfn|Grafton|Most|\
Settis|2010|page=798}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=265}} He believed in the \
Pythagorean doctrine of ''musica universalis''{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=264\
\[Dash]274}} and it was his search for the mathematical equations behind this \
doctrine that led to his discovery of the [[Kepler's laws of planetary \
motion|laws of planetary motion]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=264\[Dash]274}} \
Kepler titled his book on the subject ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (''Harmonics \
of the World''), after the Pythagorean teaching that had inspired \
him.{{sfn|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|page=798}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=162}} Near \
the conclusion of the book, Kepler describes himself falling asleep to the \
sound of the heavenly music, \\\"warmed by having drunk a generous draught... \
from the cup of Pythagoras.\\\"{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=274}}\\n\\n[[Isaac \
Newton]] firmly believed in the Pythagorean teaching of the mathematical \
harmony and order of the universe.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=279}} Though \
Newton was notorious for rarely giving others credit for their \
discoveries,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=279\[Dash]280}} he attributed the \
discovery of the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Law of Universal \
Gravitation]] to Pythagoras.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=279\[Dash]280}} \
[[Albert Einstein]] believed that a scientist may also be \\\"a Platonist or \
a Pythagorean insofar as he considers the viewpoint of logical simplicity as \
an indispensable and effective tool of his \
research.\\\"{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=172}} The English philosopher [[Alfred \
North Whitehead]] argued that \\\"In a sense, Plato and Pythagoras stand \
nearer to modern physical science than does Aristotle. The two former were \
mathematicians, whereas Aristotle was the son of a \
doctor\\\".{{sfn|Whitehead|1953|pages=36\[Dash]37}} By this measure, \
Whitehead declared that Einstein and other modern scientists like him are \
\\\"following the pure Pythagorean \
tradition.\\\"{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=172}}{{sfn|Whitehead|1953|page=36}}\\n\\n==\

Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''Pythagoras Advocating \
Vegetarianism'' (1618-1620) by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] was inspired by \
Pythagoras's speech in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=192}} \
The painting portrays the Pythagoreans with corpulent bodies, indicating a \
belief that vegetarianism was healthful and \
nutritious.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=192}}]]\\n\\nA fictionalized portrayal of \
Pythagoras appears in Book XV of [[Ovid]]'s \
''[[Metamorphoses]]'',{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=189}} in which he delivers a \
speech imploring his followers to adhere to a strictly vegetarian \
diet.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|pages=189\[Dash]190}} It was through [[Arthur \
Golding]]'s 1567 English translation of Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' that \
Pythagoras was best known to English-speakers throughout the early modern \
period.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|pages=189\[Dash]190}} [[John Donne]]'s ''Progress of \
the Soul'' discusses the implications of the doctrines expounded in the \
speech{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} and [[Michel de Montaigne]] quoted the \
speech no less than three times in his treatise ''Of Cruelty'' to voice his \
moral objections against eating meat.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} [[William \
Shakespeare]] references the speech in his play ''[[The Merchant of \
Venice]]''.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=282}} [[John Dryden]] included a \
translation of the scene with Pythagoras in his 1700 work ''[[Fables, Ancient \
and Modern]]''{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} and [[John Gay]]'s 1726 fable \
\\\"Pythagoras and the Countryman\\\" reiterates its major themes, linking \
carnivorism with tyranny.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} [[Lord Chesterfield]] \
records that his conversion to vegetarianism had been motivated by reading \
Pythagoras's speech in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} \
Until the word ''vegetarianism'' was coined in the 1840s, vegetarians were \
referred to in English as \\\"Pythagoreans\\\".{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} \
[[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] wrote an ode entitled \\\"To the Pythagorean \
Diet\\\"{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=294}} and [[Leo Tolstoy]] adopted the \
Pythagorean diet himself.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=294}}\\n\\n===On Western \
esotericism===\\nEarly modern [[Western esotericism|European esotericism]] \
drew heavily on the teachings of \
Pythagoras.{{sfn|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|page=798}} The German [[Renaissance \
humanism|humanist]] scholar [[Johannes Reuchlin]] (1455\[Dash]1522) \
synthesized Pythagoreanism with [[Christian theology]] and Jewish \
[[Kabbalah]],{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=127\[Dash]128}} arguing that Kabbalah \
and Pythagoreanism were both inspired by [[Moses|Mosaic]] \
tradition{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=128}} and that Pythagoras was therefore a \
kabbalist.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=128}} In his dialogue ''De verbo mirifico'' \
(1494), Reuchlin compared the Pythagorean tetractys to the \
[[Ineffability|ineffable]] divine name \
[[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]],{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=127\[Dash]128}} ascribing \
each of the four letters of the tetragrammaton a symbolic meaning according \
to Pythagorean mystical \
teachings.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=128}}\\n\\n[[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]'s \
popular and influential three-volume treatise ''[[Three Books of Occult \
Philosophy|De Occulta Philosophia]]'' cites Pythagoras as a \\\"religious \
magi\\\"{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} and indicates that Pythagoras's mystical \
numerology operates on a [[Allegory in Renaissance literature#Three world \
theory|supercelestial]] level.{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} The \
[[Freemasonry|freemasons]] deliberately modeled their society on the \
community founded by Pythagoras at Croton.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=133}} \
[[Rosicrucianism]] used Pythagorean \
symbolism,{{sfn|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|page=798}} as did [[Robert Fludd]] \
(1574\[Dash]1637),{{sfn|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|page=798}} who believed his \
own musical writings to have been inspired by \
Pythagoras.{{sfn|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|page=798}} [[John Dee]] was heavily \
influenced by Pythagorean \
ideology,{{sfn|Sherman|1995|page=15}}{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} particularly \
the teaching that all things are made of \
numbers.{{sfn|Sherman|1995|page=15}}{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} [[Adam \
Weishaupt]], the founder of the [[Illuminati]], was a strong admirer of \
Pythagoras{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=284\[Dash]288}} and, in his book \
''Pythagoras'' (1787), he advocated that society should be reformed to be \
more like Pythagoras's commune at \
Croton.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=287\[Dash]288}} [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] \
incorporated Masonic and Pythagorean symbolism into his opera ''[[The Magic \
Flute]]''.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=286\[Dash]287}} [[Sylvain \
Mar\[EAcute]chal]], in his six-volume 1799 biography ''The Voyages of \
Pythagoras'', declared that all revolutionaries in all time periods are the \
\\\"heirs of Pythagoras\\\".{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=288}}\\n\\n===On \
literature===\\n[[File:Paradiso Canto 31.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|[[Dante \
Alighieri]]'s description of Heaven in his ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' \
incorporates Pythagorean numerology.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=89}}]]\\n\\n[[Dante \
Alighieri]] was fascinated by Pythagorean numerology{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=89}} \
and based his descriptions of [[Hell]], [[Purgatory]], and [[Heaven]] on \
Pythagorean numbers.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=89}} Dante wrote that Pythagoras saw \
Unity as Good and Plurality as Evil{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=90}} and, in \
''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' XV, 56\[Dash]57, he declares: \\\"five and \
six, if understood, ray forth from \
unity.\\\"{{sfn|Haag|2013|pages=90\[Dash]91}} The number eleven and its \
multiples are found throughout the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', each book of which \
has thirty-three [[canto]]s, except for the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', \
which has thirty-four, the first of which serves as a general \
introduction.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} Dante describes the ninth and tenth \
bolgias in the Eighth Circle of Hell as being twenty-two miles and eleven \
miles respectively,{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} which correspond to the fraction \
{{sfrac|22|7}}, which was the Pythagorean approximation of \
[[pi]].{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven are all \
described as circular{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} and Dante compares the wonder \
of [[God in Christianity|God]]'s majesty to the mathematical puzzle of \
[[squaring the circle]].{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} The number three also \
features prominently:{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} the ''Divine Comedy'' has \
three parts{{sfn|Haag|2013|pages=91\[Dash]92}} and [[Beatrice \
Portinari|Beatrice]] is associated with the number nine, which is equal to \
three times three.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=92}}\\n\\nThe \
[[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]] read the ancient ''Lives of \
Pythagoras'' as guides on how to live a model \
life.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}} [[Henry David Thoreau]] was impacted by \
[[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]]'s translations of Iamblichus's \
''Life of Pythagoras'' and [[Stobaeus]]'s ''Pythagoric \
Sayings''{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}} and his views on nature may have been \
influenced by the Pythagorean idea of images corresponding to \
archetypes.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}} The Pythagorean teaching of ''musica \
universalis'' is a recurring theme throughout Thoreau's ''[[magnum opus]]'', \
''[[Walden]]''.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}}\\n\\n==See also==\\n* \

philosophy and the spirit of scientific inquiry from [[Ionia]] to Athens.  \
His observations of the celestial bodies and the fall of [[meteorite]]s led \
him to form new theories of the universal order, and to a putative prediction \
of the impact of a [[Aegospotami|meteorite in 467]].<ref>Couprie, Dirk L. \

the moon is earthy, and that the stars are fiery \

existed in some way from the beginning, but originally they existed in \
infinitesimally small fragments of themselves, endless in number and \
inextricably combined throughout the universe. All things existed in this \
mass, but in a confused and indistinguishable form.<ref name=\\\"EB1911\\\"/> \

to begin [[Nathanael West]]'s first book \\\"[[The Dream Life of Balso \

[[Goethe|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].\\n\\nAnaxagoras appears as a character \
in ''The Ionia Sanction'', by [[Gary Corby]].\\n\\nAnaxagoras is referred to \
and admired by Cyrus Spitama, the hero and narrator of ''[[Creation \
(novel)|Creation]]'', by [[Gore Vidal]]. The book contains this passage, \
explaining how Anaxagoras became influential:\\n\\n:[According to Anaxagoras] \
One of the largest things is a hot stone that we call the sun. When \
Anaxagoras was very young, he predicted that sooner or later a piece of the \
sun would break off and fall to earth. Twenty years ago, he was proved right. \
The whole world saw a fragment of the sun fall in a fiery arc through the \
sky, landing near [[Aegospotami]] in Thrace. When the fiery fragment cooled, \
it proved to be nothing more than a chunk of brown rock. Overnight Anaxagoras \
was famous. Today his book is read everywhere. You can buy a secondhand copy \
in the Agora for a drachma.<ref>Vidal, Gore, ''Creation: restored edition'', \
chapter 2, Vintage Books (2002)</ref>\\n\\n[[William H. Gass]] begins his \
novel, ''The Tunnel'' (1995), with a quote from Anaxagoras: \\\"The descent \
to hell is the same from every place.\\\"\\n\\nHe is also mentioned in \
Seneca's Natural Questions (Book 4B, originally Book 3: On Clouds, Hail, \
Snow) It reads: \\\"Why should I too allow myself the same liberty as \
Anaxagoras allowed himself?\\\"\\n\\n[[Dante Alighieri]] places Anaxagoras in \
the First Circle of Hell (Limbo) in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' \
(''[[Inferno_(Dante)|Inferno]]'', Canto IV, line 118).\\n\\n==See also==\\n* \

Greece|Greek]] [[pre-Socratic philosopher]] and a citizen of [[Akragas]], a \
Greek city in [[Sicily]]. Empedocles' philosophy is best known for \
originating the [[cosmogenic]] theory of the four [[classical elements]]. He \
also proposed forces he called Love and Strife which would mix and separate \
the elements, respectively. These physical speculations were part of a \
history of the universe which also dealt with the origin and development of \
life.\\n\\nInfluenced by the [[Pythagoreans]], Empedocles was a \
[[vegetarian]] who supported the doctrine of [[reincarnation]]. He is \
generally considered the last Greek philosopher to have recorded his ideas in \
verse. Some of his work survives, more than is the case for any other \
pre-Socratic philosopher. Empedocles' death was mythologized by ancient \
writers, and has been the subject of a number of literary \
treatments.\\n\\n==Life==\\n[[File:Temple of Hera - Agrigento - Italy \

family.<ref>Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius, viii. 51</ref> Very little is \
known about his life. His father Meton seems to have been instrumental in \
overthrowing the tyrant of Akragas, presumably [[Thrasydaeus]] in 470 BC. \
Empedocles continued this tradition by helping to overthrow the succeeding \
[[oligarchic]] government. He is said to have been magnanimous in his support \
of the poor;<ref>Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius, viii. 73</ref> severe in \
persecuting the overbearing conduct of the \
[[oligarchy|oligarchs]];<ref>Timaeus, ap. Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius, \

''de Curios. Princ.'', ''adv. Colotes''; Pliny, ''H. N.'' xxxvi. 27, and \
others</ref> produced many myths and stories surrounding his name. In his \
poem ''Purifications'' he claimed miraculous powers, including the \
destruction of evil, the curing of old age, and the controlling of wind and \
rain.\\n\\nEmpedocles was acquainted or connected by friendship with the \

262\[Dash]300.jpg|thumb|right|A piece of the Strasbourg Empedocles papyrus in \
the [[Biblioth\[EGrave]que nationale et universitaire]], \
Strasbourg]]\\nEmpedocles is considered the last Greek philosopher to write \
in verse and the surviving fragments of his teaching are from two poems, \
''Purifications'' and ''On Nature''. Empedocles was undoubtedly acquainted \
with the didactic poems of [[Xenophanes]] and [[Parmenides]]<ref>Hermippus \
and Theophrastus, ap. Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius, viii. 55, 56</ref>\
\[LongDash]allusions to the latter can be found in the \
fragments\[LongDash]but he seems to have surpassed them in the animation and \
richness of his style, and in the clearness of his descriptions and diction. \
[[Aristotle]] called him the father of [[rhetoric]], and, although he \
acknowledged only the [[Meter (poetry)|meter]] as a point of comparison \
between the poems of Empedocles and the epics of [[Homer]], he described \
Empedocles as Homeric and powerful in his diction.<ref>Aristotle, \
''Poetics'', 1, ap. Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius, viii. 57.</ref> \
[[Lucretius]] speaks of him with enthusiasm, and evidently viewed him as his \
model.<ref>See especially Lucretius, i. 716, etc. Refer to \
{{harvp|Sedley|1998}}.</ref> The two poems together comprised 5000 \
lines.<ref>Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius, viii. 77</ref> About 550 lines of \
his poetry survive, although because ancient writers rarely mentioned which \
poem they were quoting, it is not always certain to which poem the quotes \
belong. Some scholars now believe that there was only one poem, and that the \
''Purifications'' merely formed the beginning of ''On Nature''.<ref>Simon Tr\
\[EAcute]panier, (2004), ''Empedocles: An Interpretation'', \
Routledge.</ref>\\n\\n===''Purifications''===\\nWe possess only about 100 \
fragments that have been ascribed to his ''Purifications''. It seems to have \
given a mythical account of the world which may, nevertheless, have been part \
of Empedocles' philosophical system. The first lines of the poem are \
preserved by [[Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius]]:\\n<poem>\\nFriends who \
inhabit the mighty town by tawny Acragas\\nwhich crowns the citadel, caring \
for good deeds,\\ngreetings; I, an immortal God, no longer mortal,\\nwander \
among you, honoured by all,\\nadorned with holy diadems and blooming \
garlands.\\nTo whatever illustrious towns I go,\\nI am praised by men and \
women, and accompanied\\nby thousands, who thirst for deliverance,\\nsome ask \
for prophecies, and some entreat,\\nfor remedies against all kinds of \
disease.<ref>[[Diels\[Dash]Kranz numbering system|DK]] frag. B112 (Diogenes \
La\[EDoubleDot]rtius, viii. 61)</ref>\\n</poem>\\nIt was probably this work \
which contained a story about [[soul]]s,<ref>Frag. B115 (Plutarch, ''On \
Exile'', 607 C\[Dash]E; Hippolytus, vii. 29)</ref> where we are told that \
there were once spirits who lived in a state of bliss, but having committed a \
crime (the nature of which is unknown) they were punished by being forced to \
become mortal beings, [[reincarnate]]d from body to body. Humans, animals, \
and even plants are such spirits. The moral conduct recommended in the poem \
may allow us to become like [[Pantheon (gods)|gods]] again.\\n\\n===''On \
Nature''===\\nThere are about 450 lines of his poem ''On Nature'' extant, \
including 70 lines which have been reconstructed from some papyrus scraps \
known as the ''Strasbourg Papyrus''. The poem originally consisted of 2000 \
lines of [[hexameter]] verse,<ref>Suda, ''Empedocles''</ref> and was \
addressed to [[Pausanias of Sicily|Pausanias]].<ref>Diogenes \
La\[EDoubleDot]rtius, viii. 60</ref> It was this poem which outlined his \
philosophical system. In it, Empedocles explains not only the nature and \
history of the universe, including his theory of the four [[classical \
element]]s, but he describes theories on causation, perception, and thought, \
as well as explanations of terrestrial phenomena and biological processes.\\n\
\\n==Philosophy==\\n[[File:Empedocles-2-sized.jpg|right|thumb|Empedocles as \
portrayed in the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]]]]\\nAlthough acquainted with the \
theories of the [[Eleatics]] and the [[Pythagoreans]], Empedocles did not \
belong to any one definite school. An [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] in his \
thinking, he combined much that had been suggested by [[Parmenides]], \
[[Pythagoras]] and the [[Ionian school (philosophy)|Ionian school]]s. He was \
a firm believer in [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic mysteries]], as well as a \
scientific thinker and a precursor of [[physics]]. Aristotle mentions \
Empedocles among the Ionic philosophers, and he places him in very close \
relation to the [[atomism|atomist]] philosophers and to \
[[Anaxagoras]].<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', i. 3, 4, 7, ''Phys.'' i. 4, \
''de General, et Corr.'' i. 8, ''de Caelo'', iii. 7.</ref>\\n\\nAccording to \
House (1956)<ref>{{cite book |last=House |first=Humphry \
|url=https://archive.org/details/aristotlespoetic032945mbp |page=32 \
|title=Aristotles Poetics |year=1956}}</ref>\\n:Another of the fragments of \
the dialogue ''On the Poets'' ([[Aristotle]]) treats more fully what is said \
in Poetics ch. i about ''Empedocles'', for though clearly implying that he \
was not a poet, Aristotle there says he is [[Homeric]], and an artist in \
language, skilled in metaphor and in the other devices of \
poetry.\\n\\nEmpedocles, like the Ionian philosophers and the atomists, \
continued the tradition of tragic thought which tried to find the basis of \
the relationship of the one and many. Each of the various philosophers, \
following Parmenides, derived from the Eleatics, the conviction that an \
existence could not pass into non-existence, and vice versa. Yet, each one \
had his peculiar way of describing this relation of Divine and mortal thought \
and thus of the relation of the One and the Many. In order to account for \
change in the world, in accordance with the ontological requirements of the \
Eleatics, they viewed changes as the result of mixture and separation of \
unalterable fundamental realities. Empedocles held that the four elements \
(Water, Air, Earth, and Fire) were those unchangeable fundamental realities, \
which were themselves transfigured into successive worlds by the powers of \
Love and Strife ([[Heraclitus]] had explicated the Logos or the \\\"unity of \
opposites\\\").<ref>James Luchte, Early Greek Thought: Before the Dawn, \
Bloomsbury, 2011.</ref>\\n\\n===The four elements===\\nEmpedocles established \
four ultimate [[classical elements|elements]] which make all the structures \
in the world\[LongDash][[Fire (classical element)|fire]], [[Air (classical \
element)|air]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Earth (classical \
element)|earth]]<ref>Frag. B17 (Simplicius, ''Physics'', 157\[Dash]159)</ref>\
\[LongDash] in other words, the several states of matter are represented, \
being energies, gasses, liquids, and solids. Empedocles called these four \
elements \\\"roots\\\", which he also identified with the mythical names of \
[[Zeus]], [[Hera]], [[Persephone|Nestis]], and [[Aidoneus]]<ref>Frag. B6 \
(Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Mathematicians'', x, 315)</ref> (e.g., \
\\\"Now hear the fourfold roots of everything: enlivening Hera, Hades, \
shining Zeus. And Nestis, moistening mortal springs with \
tears.\\\"<ref>[[Peter Kingsley (scholar)|Peter Kingsley]], in ''Ancient \
Philosophy, Mystery, and Magic: Empedocles and Pythagorean Tradition'' \
(Oxford University Press, 1995).</ref>) Empedocles never used the term \
\\\"element\\\" ({{lang|grc|\[Sigma]\[Tau]\[Omicron]\[Iota]\[Chi]\
\[CurlyEpsilon]\:1fd6\[Omicron]\[Nu]}}, ''stoicheion''), which seems to have \
been first used by [[Plato]].<ref>Plato, ''Timaeus'', 48b\[Dash]c</ref> \
According to the different proportions in which these four indestructible and \
unchangeable elements are combined with each other the difference of the \
structure is produced. It is in the aggregation and segregation of elements \
thus arising, that Empedocles, like the atomists, found the real process \
which corresponds to what is popularly termed growth, increase or decrease. \
Nothing new comes or can come into being; the only change that can occur is a \
change in the juxtaposition of element with element. This theory of the four \
elements became the standard [[dogma]] for the next two thousand \
years.\\n\\n===Love and Strife===\\n{{distinguish|text=the Greek deities \
[[Aphrodite|of love]] and [[Eris (mythology)|strife]]}}\\n[[File:Empedocles \
cosmic cycle concept map.svg|300px|right|thumb|Empedocles cosmic cycle is \
based on the conflict between love and strife]]\\nThe four elements, however, \
are simple, eternal, and unalterable, and as change is the consequence of \
their mixture and separation, it was also necessary to suppose the existence \
of moving powers that bring about mixture and separation. The four elements \
are both eternally brought into union and parted from one another by two \
divine powers, [[Love]] and [[Wikt:strife|Strife]]. Love ({{lang|grc|\
\[CurlyPhi]\[Iota]\[Lambda]\:03cc\[Tau]\[Eta]\[FinalSigma]}}) is responsible \
for the attraction of different forms of matter, and Strife ({{lang|grc|\[Nu]\
\[CurlyEpsilon]\:1fd6\[Kappa]\[Omicron]\[FinalSigma]}}) is the cause of their \
separation.<ref>Frag. B35, B26 (Simplicius, ''Physics'', 31\[Dash]34)</ref> \
If the four elements make up the universe, then Love and Strife explain their \
variation and harmony. Love and Strife are attractive and repulsive forces, \
respectively, which are plainly observable in human behavior, but also \
pervade the universe. The two forces wax and wane in their dominance, but \
neither force ever wholly escapes the imposition of the other.\\n\\n===The \
sphere of Empedocles===\\nAs the best and original state, there was a time \
when the pure elements and the two powers co-existed in a condition of rest \
and inertness in the form of a sphere. The elements existed together in their \
purity, without mixture and separation, and the uniting power of Love \
predominated in the sphere: the separating power of Strife guarded the \
extreme edges of the sphere.<ref>Frag. B35 (Simplicius, ''Physics'', \
31\[Dash]34; ''On the Heavens'', 528\[Dash]530)</ref> Since that time, strife \
gained more sway and the bond which kept the pure elementary substances \
together in the sphere was dissolved. The elements became the world of \
phenomena we see today, full of contrasts and oppositions, operated on by \
both Love and Strife. The sphere being the embodiment of pure existence is \
the embodiment or representative of [[God]]. Empedocles assumed a cyclical \
universe whereby the elements return and prepare the formation of the sphere \
for the next period of the universe.\\n\\n===Cosmogony===\\nEmpedocles \
attempted to explain the separation of elements, the formation of earth and \
sea, of Sun and Moon, of atmosphere. He also dealt with the first origin of \
plants and animals, and with the [[physiology]] of humans. As the elements \
entered into combinations, there appeared strange results\[LongDash]heads \
without necks, arms without shoulders.<ref>Frag. B57 (Simplicius, ''On the \
Heavens'', 586)</ref> Then as these fragmentary structures met, there were \
seen horned heads on human bodies, bodies of oxen with human heads, and \
figures of [[intersexuality|double sex]].<ref>Frag. B61 (Aelian, ''On \
Animals'', xvi 29)</ref> But most of these products of natural forces \
disappeared as suddenly as they arose; only in those rare cases where the \
parts were found to be adapted to each other did the complex structures last. \
Thus the organic universe sprang from spontaneous aggregations that suited \
each other as if this had been intended. Soon various influences reduced \
creatures of double sex to a male and a female, and the world was replenished \
with organic life. It is possible to see this theory as an anticipation of \
[[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]], although Empedocles was \
not trying to explain [[evolution]].<ref>Ted Everson (2007), ''The gene: a \
historical perspective'' page 5. Greenwood</ref>\\n\\n===Perception and \
knowledge===\\nEmpedocles is credited with the first comprehensive theory of \
light and vision. He put forward the idea that we see objects because light \
streams out of our eyes and touches them. While flawed, this became the \
fundamental basis on which later Greek philosophers and mathematicians like \
[[Euclid]] would construct some of the most important theories of light, \
vision, and optics.<ref name = Ep1>''[[Let There be Light]]'' 7 August 2006 \
01:50 BBC Four</ref>\\n\\nKnowledge is explained by the principle that \
elements in the things outside us are perceived by the corresponding elements \
in ourselves.<ref>Frag. B109 (Aristotle, ''On the Soul'', \
404b11\[Dash]15)</ref> Like is known by like. The whole body is full of \
[[Sweat pore|pores]] and hence [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] takes \
place over the whole frame. In the organs of sense these pores are specially \
adapted to receive the effluences which are continually rising from bodies \
around us; thus  [[perception]] occurs.<ref \

htm Frag. B100] (Aristotle, ''On Respiration'', 473b1\[Dash]474a6)</ref> In \
vision, certain particles go forth from the eye to meet similar particles \
given forth from the object, and the resultant contact constitutes \
vision.<ref>Frag. B84 (Aristotle, ''On the Senses and their Objects'', 437b23\
\[Dash]438a5)</ref> Perception is not merely a passive reflection of external \
objects.\\n\\nEmpedocles noted the limitation and narrowness of human \
perceptions. We see only a part but fancy that we have grasped the whole. But \
the senses cannot lead to truth; thought and reflection must look at the \
thing from every side. It is the business of a philosopher, while laying bare \
the fundamental difference of elements, to show the identity that exists \
between what seem unconnected parts of the universe.<ref>Frag. B2 (Sextus \
Empiricus, ''Against the Mathematicians'', vii. \

\\\"frag100\\\"/> Empedocles attempted to explain the phenomena of \
[[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] by means of an elaborate analogy \
with the [[Water thief|clepsydra]], an ancient device for conveying liquids \
from one vessel to another.<ref name=\\\"barnes313\\\">[[Jonathan Barnes]] \

circumstantial evidence to support this. Plato mentions him in ''Erastae: A \
Dialogue On Philosophy'' which places him in Athens.<ref \

footnote 3) one other aspect in Oenopides life which was his travel in Egypt \
in which he enriched his knowledge in the art of Astronomy and Geometry by \
some Egyptian priests.<ref name=\\\":0\\\" />\\n\\n== Astronomy ==\\nThe main \
accomplishment of Oenopides as an astronomer was his determination of the \
angle between the plane of the celestial equator, and the [[zodiac]] (the \
yearly path of the sun in the sky). He found this angle to be 24\[Degree]. In \
effect this amounted to measuring the inclination of the earth axis. \
Oenopides's result remained the standard value for two centuries, until \
[[Eratosthenes]] measured it with greater precision.<ref>{{Cite \

9781444338386.wbeah21234/abstract}}</ref>\\n\\nOenopides also determined the \
value of the Great Year, that is, the shortest interval of time that is equal \
to both an integer number of [[sidereal year|years]] and an integer number of \
[[synodic month|months]]. As the relative positions of the sun and moon \
repeat themselves after each Great Year, this offers a means to predict solar \
and lunar [[eclipse]]s. In actual practice this is only approximately true, \
because the ratio of the length of the year and that of the month does not \
exactly match any simple mathematical fraction, and because in addition the \
lunar orbit varies continuously.\\n\\nOenopides put the Great Year at 59 \
years, corresponding to 730 months. This was a good approximation, but not a \
perfect one, since 59 (sidereal) years are equal to 21550.1 days, while 730 \
(synodical) months equal 21557.3 days. The difference therefore amounts to \
seven days. In addition there are the interfering variations in the lunar \
orbit. However, a 59-year period had the advantage that it corresponded quite \
closely to an integer number of orbital revolutions of several [[planet]]s \
around the sun, which meant that their relative positions also repeated each \
Great Year cycle. Before Oenopides a Great Year of eight solar years was in \
use (= 99 months). Shortly after Oenopides, in 432 BC, [[Meton]] and \
[[Euctemon]] discovered the better value of 18 years, equal to 223 months \
(the so-called [[Saros (astronomy)|Saros]] period).\\n\\n== Geometry \
==\\nWhile Oenopides's innovations as an astronomer mainly concern practical \
issues, as a geometer he seems to have been rather a theorist and \
methodologist, who set himself the task to make geometry comply with higher \
standards of theoretical purity. Thus he introduced the distinction between \
'theorems' and 'problems': though both are involved with the solution of an \
exercise, a theorem is meant to be a theoretical building block to be used as \
the fundament of further theory, while a problem is only an isolated exercise \
without further follow-up or importance.\\n\\nOenopides apparently also was \
the author of the rule that geometrical constructions should use no other \
means than [[compass and straightedge]]. In this context his name adheres to \
two specific elementary constructions of plane geometry: first, to draw from \
a given point a straight line perpendicular to a given straight line; and \
second, on a given straight line and at a given point on it, to construct a \
rectilineal angle equal to a given rectilineal angle.\\n\\n== Miscellaneous \
opinions attributed to Oenopides ==\\nSeveral more opinions in various areas \
are attributed to Oenopides:\\n\\n*He is said to have given an explanation of \
the flooding of the Nile each summer. On the basis of observations of the \
temperature of water in deep wells he seems erroneously to have inferred that \
underground water is in fact cooler in summer than in winter. In winter, when \
rain fell and seeped into the ground it would soon evaporate again because of \
the heat in the soil. However, in summer, when water in the ground was \
supposedly colder, there would be less evaporation. The surplus of moisture \
would then have to be carried off otherwise, thereby causing the Nile to \
overflow.\\n* To Oenopides was attributed the opinion that formerly the sun \
had moved along the [[Milky Way]]. However, when it saw how [[Thyestes]], a \
mythological figure, was served his own son for dinner by his brother \
[[Atreus]], the sun was so horrified that it left its course and moved to the \
zodiac instead. This tradition sounds quite unreliable.\\n* Oenopides was \
said to have regarded the universe as a living organism, God or the Divine \
being its soul.\\n* He is also said to have considered air and fire as being \
the first principles of the universe.\\n\\n== References ==\\n<references \

many ancient writers refer to the writings of Zeno, none of his works survive \

says that Zeno's writings were \\\"brought to Athens for the first time on \
the occasion of\\\" the visit of Zeno and Parmenides.<ref name=parm /> Plato \
also has Zeno say that this work, \\\"meant to protect the arguments of \
Parmenides,\\\"<ref name=parm /> was written in Zeno's youth, stolen, and \
published without his consent. Plato has Socrates paraphrase the \\\"first \
thesis of the first argument\\\" of Zeno's work as follows: \\\"If being is \
many, it must be both like and unlike, and this is impossible, for neither \
can the like be unlike, nor the unlike like.\\\"<ref name=parm \
/>\\n\\nAccording to [[Proclus]] in his ''Commentary on Plato's Parmenides'', \
Zeno produced \\\"not less than forty arguments revealing \
contradictions\\\",<ref>Proclus, ''Commentary on Plato's'' Parmenides, \
p.&nbsp;29</ref> but only nine are now known.\\n\\nZeno's arguments are \
perhaps the first examples of a method of proof called ''[[reductio ad \
absurdum]]'', literally meaning ''to reduce to the absurd.'' Parmenides is \
said{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} to be the first individual to implement \
this style of argument.  This form of argument soon became known as the \
''epicheirema'' (\:1f10\[Pi]\[Iota]\[Chi]\[CurlyEpsilon]\:03af\[Rho]\[Eta]\
\[Mu]\[Alpha]). In Book VII of his ''Topics'', [[Aristotle]] says that an \
''epicheirema'' is \\\"a dialectical [[syllogism]].\\\" It is a connected \
piece of reasoning which an opponent has put forward as true. The disputant \
sets out to break down the dialectical syllogism. This destructive method of \
argument was maintained by him to such a degree that [[Seneca the Younger]] \
commented a few centuries later, \\\"If I accede to Parmenides there is \
nothing left but the One; if I accede to Zeno, not even the One is \
left.\\\"<ref name=zeno>''Zeno'' in ''The Presocratics'', Philip Wheelwright \

written by Antiphon the Sophist, or whether this was written by yet another \

''On Truth'' (P.Oxy. XI 1364 fr. 1, cols. v\[Dash]vii)]]\\nA treatise known \
as ''On Truth'', of which only fragments survive, is attributed to Antiphon \
the Sophist.  It is of great value to political theory, as it appears to be a \
precursor to natural rights theory.  The views expressed in it suggest its \
author could not be the same person as Antiphon of Rhamnus, since it was \
interpreted as affirming strong egalitarian and libertarian principles \
appropriate to a democracy &mdash; but antithetical to the oligarchical views \
of one who was instrumental in the anti-democratic coup of 411 like Antiphon \
of Rhamnus.<ref>W. K C. Guthrie, ''The Sophists'', Cambridge: Cambridge \
University Press, 1971; see also Mario Untersteiner who cites Oxyrhynchus \
Papyrus #1364 fragment 2 in his ''The Sophists'', tr. Kathleen Freeman \
(Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1954), p. 252</ref>  It's been argued that that \
interpretation has become obsolete in light of a new fragment of text from \
''On Truth'' discovered in 1984.  New evidence supposedly rules out an \
egalitarian interpretation of the text.<ref>pp. 351, 356, Gerard Pendrick, \

C.Rowe & M.Schofield, ''The Cambridge Companion to Greek and Roman Political \
Thought'', Cambridge 2005.</ref>\\n\\nThe following passages may confirm the \
strongly [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] commitments of Antiphon the \
Sophist.\\n\\n===\\\"Nature\\\" requires liberty===\\n''On Truth'' juxtaposes \
the repressive nature of convention and law ({{lang|grc|\[Nu]\:03cc\[Mu]\
\[Omicron]\[FinalSigma]}}) with \\\"nature\\\" ({{lang|grc|\[CurlyPhi]\:03cd\
\[Sigma]\[Iota]\[FinalSigma]}}), especially  human nature.  Nature is \
envisaged as requiring spontaneity and freedom, in contrast to the often \
gratuitous restrictions imposed by institutions:\\n\\n<blockquote>Most of the \
things which are legally just are [none the less]&nbsp;... inimical to \
nature.  By law it has been laid down for the eyes what they should see and \
what they should not see; for the ears what they should hear and they should \
not hear; for the tongue what it should speak, and what it should not speak; \
for the hands what they should do and what they should not do ... and for the \
mind what it should desire, and what it should not desire.<ref>Antiphon, ''On \
Truth,'' ''[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]'', xi, no. 1364, fragment 1, quoted in \
Donald Kagan (ed.) ''Sources in Greek Political Thought from Homer to \
Polybius'' \\\"Sources in Western Political Thought, A. Hacker, gen. ed.; New \
York: Free Press, 2965</ref> </blockquote>\\n\\nRepression means pain, \
whereas it is nature (human nature) to shun pain.\\n\\nElsewhere, Antiphon \
wrote: \\\"Life is like a brief vigil, and the duration of life like a single \
day, as it were, in which having lifted our eyes to the light we give place \
to other who succeed us.\\\"<ref>Fr. 50 DK, quoted at [[Stobaeus]] \
4.34.63.</ref> Mario Untersteiner comments: \\\"If death follows according to \
nature, why torment its opposite, life, which is equally according to nature? \
 By appealing to this tragic law of existence, Antiphon, speaking with the \
voice of humanity, wishes to shake off everything that can do violence to the \
individuality of the person.\\\"<ref>Mario Untersteiner, ''The Sophists'', \
tr. Kathleen Freeman (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1954) Cambridge: Cambridge \
University Press, 1971, p.&nbsp;247</ref> It is reported that Antiphon set up \
a booth in a public agora where he offered consolation to the \
bereaved.<ref>Michael Gagarin, ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece \
and Rome'', Volume 1 (2010), p. 281.</ref>\\n\\nIn his championship of the \
natural liberty and equality of all men, Antiphon anticipates the natural \
rights doctrine of Locke, and the Declaration of Independence.\\n\\n=== \
Mathematics ===\\n{{Further|Bryson of Heraclea|Pi|squaring the \
circle}}\\nAntiphon was also a capable mathematician. Antiphon, alongside his \
companion [[Bryson of Heraclea]], was the first to give an upper and lower \
bound for the value of [[pi]] by inscribing and then circumscribing a polygon \
around a circle and finally proceeding to calculate the polygons' areas. This \
method was applied to the problem of [[squaring the circle]].\\n\\n===The \
''Anonymus Iamblichi''===\\n\\n[[Iamblichus]]' ''Protrepticus'' contains a \
lengthy excerpt from an important early author (studied by scholars as part \
of the Sophistic movement), on education and political philosophy. This \
passage was originally identified by [[Friedrich Blass]] in 1889 as the work \
of Antiphon, but this attribution has not been generally accepted. This work \
is accordingly referred to in modern scholarship as the ''Anonymus \
Iamblichi''.<ref>{{cite \

the earliest Greek to develop the theory of [[atomism]]\[LongDash]the idea \
that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible \
elements called [[atom]]s. Leucippus often appears as the master to his pupil \
[[Democritus]], a philosopher also touted as the originator of the atomic \
theory. However, a brief notice in [[Diogenes Laertius]]\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
life of [[Epicurus]] says that on the testimony of [[Epicurus]], Leucippus \
never existed. As the philosophical heir of Democritus, Epicurus's word has \
some weight, and indeed a controversy over this matter raged in German \
scholarship for many years at the close of the 19th century. Furthermore, in \
his ''Corpus Democriteum'',<ref>Jonathan Barnes, ''Early Greek Philosophy'', \
1987</ref> [[Thrasyllus of Alexandria]], an astrologer and writer living \
under the emperor [[Tiberius]] (14\[Dash]37 CE), compiled a list of writings \
on atomism that he attributed to Democritus to the exclusion of Leucippus. \
The present consensus among the world's historians of philosophy is that this \
Leucippus is historical. The matter must remain moot unless more information \
is forthcoming from the record.\\n\\nLeucippus  was most likely born in \
[[Miletus]],<ref>''The Cambridge Companion to Early Greek Philosophy'', p. \
xxiii. Note that Democritus was a resident of Abdera. Some said Leucippus \
from Elea, perhaps since he was unsuitably associated with the \
[[Eleatics|Eleatic philosophers]].</ref> although [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] \
and [[Velia|Elea]] are also mentioned as possible \
birthplaces.<ref>\\n[[Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius]] says \\\"Leucippus was \
born at Elea, but some say at Abdera and others at Miletus,\\\" Diogenes La\

as his dates are not recorded and he is often mentioned in conjunction with \
his more well-known pupil Democritus. It is therefore difficult to determine \

([[Ionia]], being the Asiatic Greece or \\\"[[Asia Minor]]\\\", forms western \
Turkey today). And he was a contemporary of [[Zeno of Elea]] and \
[[Empedocles]] ([[Magna Graecia]], now part of southern Italy). He belonged \
to the same [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian School]] of [[Natural \
philosophy|naturalistic philosophy]] as [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]], and \
[[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], and he was interested in [[reality]] \
and not [[idealism]] as the Italic [[Eleatics]] were.\\n\\n[[Aristotle]] and \
his student [[Theophrastus]], however, explicitly credit Leucippus with the \
invention of Atomism. In Aristotelian terms Leucippus agreed with the Eleatic \
argument that \\\"true being does not admit of vacuum\\\" and there can be no \
movement in the absence of [[vacuum]]. Leucippus contended that since \
movement exists, there must be empty space. However, he concludes that vacuum \
is identified with nonbeing, since \\\"nothing\\\" cannot really be. \
According to Aristotle Leucippus differed from the Eleatics in not being \
encumbered by the \\\"conceptual intermingling\\\" of being and non-being, \
and [[Plato]] made the necessary distinction between \\\"grades of being and \
types of negation\\\".<ref name=\\\"abdera\\\" />\\n\\nThe title most \
attributed to Leucippus' is the lost work ''Megas Diakosmos'' (''Big \
World-System'', but this title was also attributed to Democritus whose \
companion work was ''Micros Diakosmos,'' (''Little World-System'')).<ref>The \

({{lang-grc-gre|\:1f39\[Pi]\[Pi]\[Omicron]\[Kappa]\[Rho]\:03ac\[Tau]\[Eta]\
\[FinalSigma] \:1f41 \[CapitalChi]\:1fd6\[Omicron]\[FinalSigma]}}) was an \
ancient [[Greece|Greek]] [[mathematician]], [[geometer]], and [[astronomer]] \
who lived c. 470 &ndash; c. 410 BC.\\n\\nHe was born on the isle of \
[[Chios]], where he originally was a merchant. After some misadventures (he \
was robbed by either pirates or fraudulent customs officials) he went to \
[[Athens]], possibly for [[litigation]]. There he grew into a leading \
mathematician.\\n\\nOn Chios, Hippocrates may have been a pupil of the \
mathematician and astronomer [[Oenopides]] of Chios. In his mathematical work \
there probably was some [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] influence too, perhaps \
via contacts between Chios and the neighbouring island of [[Samos]], a center \
of Pythagorean thinking: Hippocrates has been described as a \
'para-Pythagorean', a philosophical 'fellow traveler'. The ''[[reductio ad \
absurdum]]'' argument (or proof by contradiction) has been traced to \
him.<ref>[[W. W. Rouse Ball]], \
''[https://books.google.com/books?id=U9zuAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA36 A Short Account of \
the History of Mathematics]'' (1888) p. 36.</ref>\\n\\n== Mathematics \
==\\nThe major accomplishment of Hippocrates is that he was the first to \
write a systematically organized [[geometry]] textbook, called ''Elements'' (\
\[CapitalSigma]\[Tau]\[Omicron]\[Iota]\[Chi]\[CurlyEpsilon]\:1fd6\[Alpha], \
''Stoicheia''), that is, basic theorems, or building blocks of mathematical \
theory. From then on, mathematicians from all over the ancient world could, \
at least in principle, build on a common framework of basic concepts, \
methods, and theorems, which stimulated the scientific progress of \
mathematics.\\n\\nOnly a single, and famous, fragment of Hippocrates' \
''Elements'' is existent, embedded in the work of [[Simplicius of \
Cilicia|Simplicius]]. In this fragment the area is calculated of some \
so-called ''Hippocratic [[Lune (mathematics)|lunes]]'' &mdash; see [[Lune of \
Hippocrates]]. This was part of a research programme to achieve the \
\\\"[[Squaring the circle|quadrature of the circle]]\\\", that is, to \
calculate the area of the circle, or, equivalently, to construct a square \
with the same area as a circle. The strategy apparently was to divide a \
circle into a number of crescent-shaped parts. If it were possible to \
calculate the area of each of those parts, then the area of the circle as a \
whole would be known too. Only much later was it proven (by [[Ferdinand von \
Lindemann]], in 1882) that this approach had no chance of success, because \
the factor [[pi]] (\[Pi]) is [[transcendental number|transcendental]]. The \
number \[Pi] is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle, \
and also the ratio of the area to the square of the radius.\\n\\nIn the \
century after Hippocrates at least four other mathematicians wrote their own \
''Elements'', steadily improving terminology and logical structure. In this \
way Hippocrates' pioneering work laid the foundation for [[Euclid]]'s \
''Elements'' (c. 325 BC) that was to remain the standard geometry textbook \
for many centuries. Hippocrates is believed to have originated the use of \
letters to refer to the geometric points and figures in a proposition, e.g., \
\\\"triangle ABC\\\" for a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and \
C.\\n\\nTwo other contributions by Hippocrates in the field of mathematics \
are noteworthy. He found a way to tackle the problem of '[[duplication of the \
cube]]', that is, the problem of how to construct a [[cube root]]. Like the \
quadrature of the circle this was another of the so-called three great \
mathematical problems of antiquity. Hippocrates also invented the technique \
of 'reduction', that is, to transform specific mathematical problems into a \
more general problem that is more easy to solve. The solution to the more \
general problem then automatically gives a solution to the original \
problem.\\n\\n== Astronomy ==\\nIn the field of astronomy Hippocrates tried \
to explain the phenomena of [[comet]]s and the [[Milky Way]]. His ideas have \
not been handed down very clearly, but probably he thought both were optical \
illusions, the result of [[refraction]] of solar light by moisture that was \
exhaled by, respectively, a putative planet near the sun, and the stars. The \
fact that Hippocrates thought that light rays originated in our eyes instead \
of in the object that is seen adds to the unfamiliar character of his \
ideas.\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n== References ==\\n* [[Ivor \

roots of the non-square numbers up to 17 are \
irrational:\\n<blockquote>\\nTheodorus here was drawing some figures for us \

seventeen square feet and at that he stopped.<ref>{{cite book \

the theorem is that a real number with an ''infinite'' [[continued fraction]] \
expansion is irrational. Irrational square roots have [[Periodic continued \
fraction|periodic expansions]]. The period of the square root of 19 has \
length 6, which is greater than the period of the square root of any smaller \

sources say that Democritus followed in the tradition of [[Leucippus]] and \
that they carried on the scientific rationalist philosophy associated with \
Miletus. Both were thoroughly [[Materialism|materialist]], believing \
everything to be the result of natural laws. Unlike Aristotle or Plato, the \
[[Atomism|atomists]] attempted to explain the world without reasoning as to \
''purpose'', ''[[Unmoved mover|prime mover]]'', or ''[[final cause]]''. For \
the atomists questions of physics should be answered with a [[Mechanism \
(philosophy)|mechanistic]] explanation (\\\"What earlier circumstances caused \

addition to the material and mechanistic, also included the formal and \
teleological (\\\"What purpose did this event \

percentage of his thoughts and ideas can be known.\\n\\n===Atomic \
hypothesis===\\n{{see also|Atomism}}\\n\\nThe theory of Democritus held that \
everything is composed of \\\"atoms\\\", which are physically, but not \
geometrically, indivisible; that between atoms, there lies empty space; that \
atoms are indestructible, and have always been and always will be in motion; \
that there is an infinite number of atoms and of kinds of atoms, which differ \
in shape and size. Of the mass of atoms, Democritus said, \\\"The more any \
indivisible exceeds, the heavier it is\\\". But his exact position on atomic \
weight is disputed.<ref name=\\\"Russell64\[Dash]65\\\"/>\\n\\n[[Leucippus]] \
is widely credited with having been the first to develop the theory of \
atomism, although [[Isaac Newton]] preferred to credit the obscure \
[[Mochus|Mochus the Phoenician]] (whom he believed to be the biblical Moses) \
as the inventor of the idea on the authority of [[Posidonius]] and \
[[Strabo]].<ref>Derek Gjertsen (1986), ''The Newton Handbook'', p. 468.</ref> \

proposed the earliest views on the shapes and connectivity of atoms. They \
reasoned that the solidness of the material corresponded to the shape of the \
atoms involved. Thus, iron atoms are solid and strong with hooks that lock \
them into a solid; water atoms are smooth and slippery; salt atoms, because \
of their taste, are sharp and pointed; and air atoms are light and whirling, \
pervading all other materials.<ref>{{cite book  |last=Pfeffer |first=Jeremy, \

with hooks and eyes others with balls and sockets.<ref>See ''testimonia'' DK \

other bodies from its volume) that interacts with other atoms mechanically. \
In contrast, modern, quantum-mechanical atoms interact via electric and \
magnetic force fields and are far from inert.\\n\\nThe theory of the atomists \
appears to be more nearly aligned with that of modern science than any other \
theory of antiquity. However, the similarity with modern concepts of science \
can be confusing when trying to understand where the hypothesis came from. It \
is obvious that classical atomists would never have had a solid empirical \
basis for modern concepts of atoms and molecules.\\n\\nHowever, \
[[Lucretius]], describing atomism in his ''[[De rerum natura]]'', gives very \
clear and compelling empirical arguments for the original atomist theory. He \
observes that any material is subject to irreversible decay. Through time, \
even hard rocks are slowly worn down by drops of water. Things have the \
tendency to get mixed up: Mix water with soil and mud will result, seldom \
disintegrating by itself. Wood decays. However, there are mechanisms in \
nature and technology to recreate \\\"pure\\\" materials like water, air, and \
metals.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The seed of an oak will grow out \
into an oak tree, made of similar wood as historical oak trees, the wood of \
which has already decayed. The conclusion is that many properties of \
materials must derive from something inside, that will itself never decay, \
something that stores for eternity the same inherent, indivisible properties. \
The basic question is: Why has everything in the world not yet decayed, and \
how can exactly some of the same materials, plants, and animals be recreated \
again and again? One obvious solution to explain how indivisible properties \
can be conveyed in a way not easily visible to human senses, is to \
hypothesize the existence of \\\"atoms\\\". These classical \\\"atoms\\\" are \
nearer to humans' modern concept of \\\"molecule\\\" than to the atoms of \
modern science. The other central point of classical atomism is that there \
must be considerable open space between these \\\"atoms\\\": the void. \
Lucretius gives reasonable arguments{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} that \
the void is absolutely necessary to explain how gasses and liquids can flow \
and change shape, while metals can be molded without their basic material \
properties changing.\\n\\n===Void hypothesis===\\n[[File:Dosso Dossi \

a response to the paradoxes of [[Parmenides]] and [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]], the \
founders of metaphysical logic, who put forth difficult to answer arguments \
in favor of the idea that there can be no movement. They held that any \
movement would require a void\[LongDash]which is nothing\[LongDash]but a \
nothing cannot exist. The Parmenidean position was \\\"You say there ''is'' a \
void; therefore the void is not nothing; therefore there is not the \
void\\\".<ref name=\\\"Russell69\\\">Russell, p. 69.</ref><ref \
name=\\\"Physics\\\">Aristotle, ''Phys.'' iv.6</ref> The position of \
Parmenides appeared validated by the observation that where there seems to be \
nothing there is air, and indeed even where there is not matter there is \
''something'', for instance light waves.\\n\\nThe atomists agreed that motion \
required a void, but simply ignored the argument of Parmenides on the grounds \
that motion was an observable fact. Therefore, they asserted, there must be a \
void. This idea survived in a refined version as Newton's theory of \
[[absolute space]], which met the logical requirements of attributing reality \
to not-being. Einstein's theory of relativity provided a new answer to \
Parmenides and Zeno, with the insight that space by itself is relative and \
cannot be separated from time as part of a generally curved space-time \
manifold. Consequently, Newton's refinement is now considered \
superfluous.<ref name=\\\"Russell69\[Dash]71\\\">Russell, pp. \
69\[Dash]71.</ref>\\n\\n===Epistemology===\\n[[File:Giordano, Luca Democritus \
ca 1600.jpg|thumb|''Democritus'' by Luca Giordano ({{circa}}1690).]]\\nThe \
knowledge of truth, according to Democritus, is difficult, since the \
perception through the senses is subjective. As from the same senses derive \
different impressions for each individual, then through the sensual \
impressions we cannot judge the truth. We can interpret the senses' data and \
grasp the truth only through the intellect, because the truth is in an abyss:\
\\n\\n{{quote|And again, many of the other animals receive impressions \
contrary to ours; and even to the senses of each individual, things do not \
always seem the same. Which then, of these impressions are true and which are \
false is not obvious; for the one set is no more true than the other, but \
both are alike. And this is why Democritus, at any rate, says that either \
there is no truth or to us at least it is not evident.<ref>Aristotle, \
''Metaphysics'' iv.1009 b 7.</ref>}}\\n\\nAnd:\\n\\n{{quote|Furthermore, they \
find Xenophanes, Zeno of Elea, and Democritus to be sceptics: \[Ellipsis]  \
Democritus because he rejects qualities, saying,\\\"Opinion says hot or cold, \
but the reality is atoms and empty space,\\\" and again, \\\"Of a truth we \
know nothing, for truth is in a well.\\\"<ref>[[#DL|Diogenes \
La\[EDoubleDot]rtius]] (tr. [[Robert Drew Hicks|Hicks]], 1925), \
[[s:Lives_of_the_Eminent_Philosophers/Book_IX#cite_ref-102|ix.72]]. See also \
[[#Fr|Bakalis]] (2005, p.86)</ref>}}\\n\\nThere are two kinds of knowing, the \
one he calls \\\"legitimate\\\" (\[Gamma]\[Nu]\[Eta]\[Sigma]\:03af\[Eta], \
''gn\[EBar]si\[EBar]'', \\\"genuine\\\") and the other \\\"bastard\\\" (\
\[Sigma]\[Kappa]\[Omicron]\[Tau]\:03af\[Eta], ''skoti\[EBar]'', \
\\\"secret\\\"). The \\\"bastard\\\" knowledge is concerned with the \
perception through the senses; therefore it is insufficient and subjective. \
The reason is that the sensual perception is due to the effluences of the \
atoms from the objects to the senses. When these different shapes of atoms \
come to us, they stimulate our senses according to their shape, and our \
sensual impressions arise from those stimulations.<ref>[[#Fr|Fr. 135]] \
(Bakalis (2005)): [[Theophrastus]] 12, ''De Sensu'' [''On the Senses''], 49\
\[Dash]83.</ref>\\n\\nThe second sort of knowledge, the \\\"legitimate\\\" \
one, can be achieved through the intellect, in other words, all the sense \
data from the \\\"bastard\\\" must be elaborated through reasoning. In this \
way one can get away from the false perception of the \\\"bastard\\\" \
knowledge and grasp the truth through the inductive reasoning. After taking \
into account the sense impressions, one can examine the causes of the \
appearances, draw conclusions about the laws that govern the appearances, and \
discover the [[causality]] (\[Alpha]\:1f30\[Tau]\[Iota]\[Omicron]\[Lambda]\
\[Omicron]\[Gamma]\:03af\[Alpha], ''aetiologia'') by which they are related. \
This is the procedure of thought from the parts to the whole or else from the \
apparent to nonapparent (inductive reasoning). This is one example of why \
Democritus is considered to be an early scientific thinker. The process is \
reminiscent of that by which science gathers its \
conclusions:\\n\\n{{quote|But in the Canons Democritus says there are two \
kinds of knowing, one through the senses and the other through the intellect. \
Of these he calls the one through the intellect 'legitimate' attesting its \
trustworthiness for the judgment of truth, and through the senses he names \
'bastard' denying its inerrancy in the discrimination of what is true. To \
quote his actual words: Of knowledge there are two forms, one legitimate, one \
bastard. To the bastard belong all this group: sight, hearing, smell, taste, \
touch. The other is legitimate and separate from that. Then, preferring the \
legitimate to the bastard, he continues: When the bastard can no longer see \
any smaller, or hear, or smell, or taste, or perceive by touch, but finer \
matters have to be examined, then comes the legitimate, since it has a finer \
organ of perception.<ref>[[#Fr|Fr. 11]] (Bakalis (2005)): [[#Sextus|Sextus]] \
vii.138.</ref>}}\\n\\nAnd:\\n\\n{{quote|In the Confirmations ... he says: But \
we in actuality grasp nothing for certain, but what shifts in accordance with \
the condition of the body and of the things (atoms) which enter it and press \
upon it.<ref>[[#Fr|Fr. 9]] (Bakalis (2005)): [[#Sextus|Sextus]] \
vii.136.</ref>}}\\n\\nAs well as:\\n\\n{{quote|Democritus used to say that \
'he prefers to discover a causality rather than become a king of \

politics===\\n[[File:Bramante heracleitus and \
democritus.jpeg|thumb|left|''Crying [[Heraclitus]] and laughing Democritus'', \
from a 1477 Italian fresco, [[Pinacoteca di Brera]], Milan.]]\\nThe ethics \
and politics of Democritus come to us mostly in the form of maxims. As such, \
the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] has gone as far as to say that: \
\\\"despite the large number of ethical sayings, it is difficult to construct \
a coherent account of Democritus's ethical views\\\" and noting that there is \
a \\\"difficulty of deciding which fragments are genuinely \
Democritean\\\".<ref>{{cite \

everywhere noble\\\", but he is not encompassing enough to include women or \
slaves in this sentiment. Poverty in a democracy is better than prosperity \
under tyrants, for the same reason one is to prefer liberty over slavery.  In \
his [[A History of Western Philosophy|History of Western Philosophy]], \
[[Bertrand Russell]] writes that Democritus was in love with \\\"what the \
Greeks called democracy.\\\" Democritus said that \\\"the wise man belongs to \
all countries, for the home of a great soul is the whole world.\\\"<ref name=\
\\\":0\\\">{{Cite book|title=The Open Society and its Enemies. Vol I.: The \
Spell of Plato|last=Popper|first=Karl R.|publisher=George Routledge & \
Sons|year=1945|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>  Democritus wrote that \
those in power should \\\"take it upon themselves to lend to the poor and to \
aid them and to favor them, then is there pity and no isolation but \
companionship and mutual defense and concord among the citizens and other \
good things too many to catalogue\\\". Money when used with sense leads to \
generosity and charity, while money used in folly leads to a common expense \
for the whole society\[LongDash]excessive hoarding of money for one's \
children is avarice. While making money is not useless, he says, doing so as \
a result of wrongdoing is the \\\"worst of all things\\\". He is on the whole \
ambivalent towards wealth, and values it much less than self-sufficiency. He \
disliked violence but was not a pacifist: he urged cities to be prepared for \
war, and believed that a society had the right to execute a criminal or enemy \
so long as this did not violate some law, treaty, or oath.<ref \
name=\\\"Barnes87\\\"/>\\n\\nGoodness, he believed, came more from practice \
and discipline than from innate human nature. He believed that one should \
distance oneself from the wicked, stating that such association increases \
disposition to vice. Anger, while difficult to control, must be mastered in \
order for one to be rational. Those who take pleasure from the disasters of \
their neighbors fail to understand that their fortunes are tied to the \
society in which they live, and they rob themselves of any joy of their own. \
Democritus believed that happiness was a property of the soul. He advocated a \
life of contentment with as little grief as possible, which he said could not \
be achieved through either idleness or preoccupation with worldly pleasures. \
Contentment would be gained, he said, through moderation and a measured life; \
to be content one must set their judgment on the possible and be satisfied \
with what one has\[LongDash]giving little thought to envy or admiration. \
Democritus approved of extravagance on occasion, as he held that feasts and \
celebrations were necessary for joy and relaxation. He considers education to \
be the noblest of pursuits, but cautioned that learning without sense leads \
to error.<ref name=\\\"Barnes87\\\"/>\\n\\n===Mathematics===\\n[[File:Cone \
3d.png|thumb|250px|right|Right circular and oblique circular \
cones]]\\nDemocritus was also a pioneer of mathematics and geometry in \
particular. We only know this through citations of his works (titled  ''On \
Numbers'', ''On Geometrics'', ''On Tangencies'', ''On Mapping'', and ''On \
Irrationals'') in other writings, since most of Democritus's body of work did \
not survive the Middle Ages. Democritus was among the first to observe that a \
[[cone (geometry)|cone]] or [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] has one-third the \
[[volume]] of a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] or [[prism \
(geometry)|prism]] respectively with the same base and \
height.\\n\\n===Anthropology, biology, and cosmology===\\nHis work on nature \
is known through citations of his books on the subjects, ''On the Nature of \
Man'', ''On Flesh'' (two books), ''On Mind, On the Senses'', ''On Flavors'', \
''On Colors'',  ''Causes concerned with Seeds and Plants and Fruits'', and \
''Causes concerned with Animals'' (three books).<ref name=\\\"Barnes87\\\"/> \
He spent much of his life experimenting with and examining plants and \
minerals, and wrote at length on many scientific \
topics.<ref>[[#Petronius|Petronius ch. 88]].</ref> Democritus thought that \
the first [[humans]] lived an anarchic and animal sort of life, going out to \
forage individually and living off the most palatable herbs and the fruit \
which grew wild on the trees. They were driven together into societies for \
fear of wild animals, he said. He believed that these early people had no \
language, but that they gradually began to articulate their expressions, \
establishing symbols for every sort of object, and in this manner came to \
understand each other. He says that the earliest men lived laboriously, \
having none of the utilities of life; clothing, houses, fire, domestication, \
and farming were unknown to them. Democritus presents the early period of \
mankind as one of learning by trial and error, and says that each step slowly \
led to more discoveries; they took refuge in the caves in winter, stored \
fruits that could be preserved, and through reason and keenness of mind came \
to build upon each new idea.<ref name=\\\"Barnes87\\\"/><ref>[[#DS|Diodorus]] \
I.viii.1\[Dash]7.</ref>\\n\\nDemocritus held that originally the universe was \
composed of nothing but tiny atoms churning in chaos, until they collided \
together to form larger units\[LongDash]including the earth and everything on \
it.<ref name=\\\"Barnes87\\\"/> He surmised that [[Cosmic pluralism|there are \
many worlds]], some growing, some decaying; some with no sun or moon, some \
with several. He held that every world has a beginning and an end and that a \
world could be destroyed by collision with another world. To epitomize \
Democritus's cosmology, Russell calls on Shelley: \\\"Worlds on worlds are \
rolling ever / From creation to decay, / Like the bubbles on a river / \
Sparkling, bursting, borne away\\\".<ref>Russell, pp. \

\:026a|p|i|\:0259|s}}; {{lang-el|\:1f39\[Pi]\[Pi]\:03af\[Alpha]\[FinalSigma] \
\:1f41 \:1f28\[Lambda]\[CurlyEpsilon]\:1fd6\[Omicron]\[FinalSigma]}}; late \
5th century BC) was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[sophist]], and a \
contemporary of [[Socrates]]. With an assurance characteristic of the later \
sophists, he claimed to be regarded as an authority on all subjects, and \
lectured on [[poetry]], [[grammar]], [[history]], [[politics]], \
[[mathematics]], and much else. Most of our knowledge of him is derived from \
[[Plato]], who characterizes him as vain and \
arrogant.\\n\\n==Life==\\nHippias was born at [[Elis]] in the mid 5th-century \
BC (c. 460 BC) and was thus a younger contemporary of [[Protagoras]] and \
[[Socrates]]. He lived at least as late as Socrates (399 BC). He was a \
disciple of Hegesidamus.<ref>Suda, ''Hippias''</ref> Owing to his talent and \
skill, his fellow-citizens availed themselves of his services in political \
matters, and in a diplomatic mission to [[Sparta]].<ref>Plato, ''Hippias \
major'', 281a, 286a; Philostratus, ''Vit. Soph.'' i. 11.</ref> But he was in \
every respect like the other sophists of the time: he travelled about in \
various towns and districts of [[Classical Greece|Greece]] for the purpose of \
teaching and public speaking. The two dialogues of [[Plato]], the ''[[Hippias \
major]]'' and the ''[[Hippias minor]]'' characterize him as vain and \
arrogant. The ''Hippias major'' (the authorship of this work by Plato is \
sometimes doubted) concerns the question about the [[Beauty|beautiful]], and \
purposely puts the knowledge and presumption of Hippias in a ludicrous light. \
The ''Hippias minor'' discusses the deficiency of our [[knowledge]], and \
characterizes Hippias as ridiculously vain.\\n\\n==Work==\\nHippias was a man \
of very extensive knowledge, and he occupied himself not only with \
[[rhetoric]]al, [[philosophy|philosophical]], and [[politics|political]] \
studies, but was also well versed in [[poetry]], [[music]], [[mathematics]], \
[[painting]] and [[sculpture]], and he claimed some practical skill in the \
ordinary arts of life, for he used to boast of wearing on his body nothing \
that he had not made himself with his own hands, such as his [[Seal \
(emblem)|seal-ring]], his [[cloak]], and [[shoes]].<ref>Plato, ''Hippias \
major'', 285c, ''Hippias minor'', 368b, ''Protagoras'', 315c; Philostratus, \
''Vit. Soph.'' i. 11.; Themistius, ''Orat.'' xxix. p. 345. d.</ref> On the \
other hand, his knowledge always appears superficial, he does not enter into \
the details of any particular art or science, and is satisfied with certain \
generalities, which enabled him to speak on everything without a thorough \
knowledge of any. This arrogance, combined with ignorance, is the main cause \
which provoked Plato to his severe criticism of Hippias, as the sophist \
enjoyed a very extensive reputation, and thus had a large influence upon the \
education of the youths of the higher classes. A mathematical discovery \
ascribed to Hippias is sometimes called the [[quadratrix]] of \
Hippias.\\n\\nHis great skill seems to have consisted in delivering grand \
show speeches; and Plato has him arrogantly declaring that he would travel to \
[[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], and there deliver before the assembled Greeks an \
[[oration]] on any subject that might be proposed to him;<ref>Plat. ''Hippias \
minor'', 363</ref> and [[Philostratus]] in fact speaks of several such \
orations delivered at Olympia, and which created great sensation. If such \
speeches were published by Hippias, then no specimen has come down to us. \
Plato claims he wrote [[epic poetry]], [[tragedies]], [[dithyramb]]s, and \
various orations,<ref>Plato ''Hippias minor'', 368</ref> as well works on as \
[[grammar]], [[music]], [[rhythm]], [[harmony]], and a variety of other \
subjects.<ref>Plato, ''Hippias major'', 285ff; comp. Philostratus, ''Vit. \
Soph.'' i. 11.; Plutarch, ''Num.'' 1, 23; Dio Chrysostom, ''Orat.'' \
lxxi.</ref> He seems to have been especially fond of choosing antiquarian and \
mythical subjects for his show speeches. [[Athenaeus]] mentions a work of \
Hippias under the title ''Synagoge'' which is otherwise \
unknown.<ref>Athenaeus, xiii. 609</ref> An epigram of his is preserved in \
[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].<ref>Pausanias, v. \
25</ref>\\n\\n==Natural law==\\nHippias is credited with originating the idea \
of natural law. This ideal began at first during the fifth century B.C. \
According to Hippias, natural law was never to be superseded as it was \
universal.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kainz|first=Howard P.|title=Natural Law: An \

|id={{ISBN|9780812694543}}|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rq5hg4d54m4C&\
pg=PA2 }}</ref> Hippias saw natural law as a habitual entity that humans take \
part in without pre-meditation. He regarded the elite in states as \
indistinguishable from one another and thus they should perceive each other \
as so. Because of this they should consider and treat each other as a society \
of a unanimous state. These ideas were passed on through Cynicism and \
Stoicism later being the foundation for turning Roman law in \
legislation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Internet Encyclopedia of \
Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hippias/|accessdate=17 February \
2014}}</ref> Along with natural law, Hippias also wrote about \
self-sufficiency as a binding principle. He used this principle in his \
teachings as he gathered knowledge in numerous subjects so as to be never \
outwitted or have his reputation questioned.<ref>{{cite \

\:03ce\[Tau]\[Eta]\[FinalSigma]}}, ''gen''.: \[CapitalBeta]\[Rho]\:03cd\
\[Sigma]\[Omega]\[Nu]\[Omicron]\[FinalSigma]; fl. late 5th-century BCE) was \
an [[ancient Greek]] [[mathematician]] and [[sophist]] who contributed to \
solving the problem of [[squaring the circle]] and calculating \
[[pi]].\\n\\n==Life and work==\\nLittle is known about the life of Bryson; he \
came from [[Heraclea Pontica]], and he may have been a pupil of [[Socrates]]. \
He is mentioned in the ''[[Thirteenth Letter (Plato)|13th Platonic \
Epistle]]'',<ref>Platonic Epistles, xiii. 360c</ref> and [[Theopompus]] even \
claimed in his ''Attack upon Plato'' that [[Plato]] stole many ideas for his \
dialogues from Bryson of Heraclea.<ref>Athenaeus, xi. ch. 118, 508c-d</ref> \
He is known principally from [[Aristotle]], who criticizes his method of \
squaring the circle.<ref>Aristotle, ''Posterior Analytics'', 75b4; \
''Sophistical Refutations'', 171b16, 172a3</ref> He also upset Aristotle by \
asserting that [[obscene language]] does not exist.<ref>Aristotle, \
''Rhetoric'', 3.2, 1405b6-16</ref> [[Diogenes \
La\[EDoubleDot]rtius]]<ref>Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius, i. 16, vi. 85, ix. \
61</ref> and the [[Suda]]<ref>Suda, ''Pyrrhon'', ''Krates'', \
''Theodoros''</ref> refer several times to a Bryson as a teacher of various \
philosophers, but since some of the philosophers mentioned lived in the late \
4th-century BCE, it is possible that Bryson became confused with [[Bryson of \
Achaea]], who may have lived around that time.<ref>Robert Drew Hicks, \
''Diogenes Laertius: Lives of Eminent Philosophers'', page 88. Loeb Classical \
Library</ref>\\n\\n===Pi and squaring the circle===\\nBryson, along with his \
contemporary, [[Antiphon (person)|Antiphon]], was the first to [[inscribe]] a \
polygon inside a circle, find the [[polygon]]'s area, double the number of \
sides of the polygon, and repeat the process, resulting in a [[lower bound]] \
approximation of the [[area of a circle]]. \\\"Sooner or later (they \
figured), ...[there would be] so many sides that the polygon ...[would] be a \
circle.\\\"<ref>Blatner, page 16</ref> Bryson later followed the same \
procedure for polygons [[circumscribe|circumscribing]] a circle, resulting in \
an [[upper bound]] approximation of the area of a circle. With these \
calculations, Bryson was able to approximate \[Pi] and further place lower \
and upper bounds on \[Pi]'s true value. But due to the complexity of the \
method, he only calculated \[Pi] to a few digits. [[Aristotle]] criticized \
this method, but [[Archimedes]] would later use a [[method of \
exhaustion|method]] similar to that of Bryson and Antiphon to calculate \
\[Pi]; however, Archimedes calculated the [[perimeter]] of a polygon instead \
of the area.\\n\\n===Robert Kilwardby on Bryson's syllogism===\\nThe \
13th-century English philosopher [[Robert Kilwardby]] described Bryson's \
attempt of proving the quadrature of the circle as a [[Sophism|sophistical]] \
[[Prior Analytics#The syllogism|syllogism]]\[LongDash]one which \\\"deceives \
in virtue of the fact that it promises to yield a conclusion producing \
knowledge on the basis of specific considerations and concludes on the basis \
of common considerations that can produce only belief.\\\"<ref>Robert \
Kilwardby, ''De ortu scientiarum'', LIII, \[Section]512, pp. 272f.</ref> His \
account of the syllogism is as follows:\\n\\n{{cquote|Bryson's syllogism on \
the squaring of the circle was of this sort, it is said: ''In any genus in \
which one can find a greater and a lesser than something, one can find what \
is equal; but in the genus of squares one can find a greater and a lesser \
than a circle; therefore, one can also find a square equal to a circle.'' \
This syllogism is sophistical not because the consequence is false, and not \
because it produces a syllogism on the basis of apparently readily believable \
things-for it concludes necessarily and on the basis of what is readily \
believable. Instead, it is called sophistical and contentious \
[''litigiosus''] because it is based on common considerations and is \
dialectical when it should be based on specific considerations and be \
demonstrative.<ref>Robert Kilwardby, ''De ortu scientiarum'', LIII, \

of Tarentum]. The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive. Visited 11 August \
2011.</ref> According to [[Eutocius]], Archytas solved the problem of \
[[doubling the cube]] in his manner (though he believed \\\"that only \
arithmetic, not geometry\\\", could provide a basis for satisfactory proofs) \
with a geometric construction.<ref>[[Eutocius]], commentary on \
[[Archimedes]]' ''On the sphere and cylinder''.</ref> [[Hippocrates of \
Chios]] before, reduced this problem to finding mean [[Proportionality \
(mathematics)|proportionals]]. Archytas' theory of proportions is treated in \
book VIII of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', where is the \
construction for two proportional means, equivalent to the extraction of the \
[[cube root]]. According to [[Diogenes Laertius]], this demonstration, which \
uses lines generated by moving figures to construct the two proportionals \
between magnitudes, was the first in which geometry was studied with concepts \
of mechanics.<ref>[[Plato]] blamed Archytas for his contamination of geometry \
with mechanics ([[Plutarch]], \
[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/plutarch/symposiacs/chapter8.html#section80 \
''Symposiacs'', Book VIII, Question 2]): ''And therefore Plato himself \
dislikes Eudoxus, Archytas, and Menaechmus for endeavoring to bring down the \
doubling the cube to mechanical operations; for by this means all that was \
good in geometry would be lost and corrupted, it falling back again to \
sensible things, and not rising upward and considering immaterial and \
immortal images, in which God being versed is always God.''</ref> The \
[[Archytas#Archytas curve|Archytas curve]], which he used in his solution of \
the doubling the cube problem, is named after him.\\n\\nPolitically and \
militarily, Archytas appears to have been the dominant figure in Tarentum in \
his generation, somewhat comparable to [[Pericles]] in [[Athens]] a \
half-century earlier. The Tarentines elected him ''[[strategos]]'', \
'general', seven years in a row \[Dash] a step that required them to violate \
their own rule against successive appointments. He was allegedly undefeated \
as a general, in Tarentine campaigns against their southern Italian \
neighbors. The ''[[Seventh Letter (Plato)|Seventh Letter]]'' of [[Plato]] \
asserts that Archytas attempted to rescue Plato during his difficulties with \
[[Dionysius the Younger|Dionysius II]] of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. In \
his public career, Archytas had a reputation for virtue as well as efficacy. \
Some scholars have argued that Archytas may have served as one model for \
Plato's [[philosopher king]], and that he influenced Plato's political \
philosophy as expressed in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' and \
other works (i.e., how does a society obtain good rulers like Archytas, \
instead of bad ones like Dionysius II?).\\n\\nArchytas may have drowned in a \
shipwreck in the shore of [[Mattinata]], where his body lay unburied on the \
shore until a sailor humanely cast a handful of sand on it. Otherwise, he \
would have had to wander on this side of the [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]] for a \
hundred years, such the virtue of a little dust, ''munera pulveris'', as \
[[Horace]] calls it in Ode 1.28 on which this information on his death is \
based. The poem, however, is difficult to interpret and it is not certain \
that the shipwrecked and Archytas are in fact the same person.\\n\\nThe \
crater [[Archytas (crater)|Archytas]] on the [[Moon]] is named in his honour.\
\\n\\n===Archytas curve<!--'Archytas curve' redirects \
here-->===\\n[[File:Archytas curve.png|thumb|The Archytas curve]]\\nThe \
'''Archytas curve''' is created by placing a semicircle (with a diameter of \
d) on the diameter of one of the two circles of a cylinder (which also has a \
diameter of d) such that the plane of the semicircle is at right angles to \
the plane of the circle and then rotating the semicircle about one of its \
ends in the plane of the cylinder's diameter. This rotation will cut out a \
portion of the cylinder forming the Archytas \
curve.<ref>http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/davies/cubedbl.htm</ref>\\n\\\
nAnother way of thinking of this construction is that the Archytas curve is \
basically the result of cutting out a torus formed by rotating a hemisphere \
of diameter d out of a cylinder also of diameter d. A cone can go through the \
same procedures also producing the Archytas curve. Archytas used his curve to \
determine the construction of a cube with a volume of one third of that of a \
given cube.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\\n\\n==Notes==\\n{{reflist|2}}\

been the founder of Western [[political philosophy]], with his [[Plato's \

providing some of the earliest extant treatments of political questions from \
a philosophical perspective. Plato's own most decisive philosophical \

life===\\n{{Main article|Early life of Plato}}\\nDue to a lack of surviving \
accounts, little is known about Plato's early life and education. The \
philosopher came from one of the wealthiest and most politically active \
families in&nbsp;Athens. Ancient sources describe him as a bright though \
modest boy who excelled in his studies. His father contributed all which was \
necessary to give to his son a good education, and, therefore, Plato must \
have been instructed in grammar, music, gymnastics and philosophy by some of \
the most distinguished teachers of his era.\\n\\n====Birth and \
family====\\nThe exact time and place of Plato's birth are unknown, but it is \
certain that he belonged to an aristocratic and influential family. Based on \
ancient sources, most modern scholars believe that he was born in Athens or \
[[Aegina]]{{Ref label|C|c|none}} between 429 and 423 BC. His father was \
[[Ariston (Athenian)|Ariston]]. According to a disputed tradition, reported \
by [[Diogenes Laertius]], Ariston traced his descent from the [[king of \
Athens]], [[Codrus]], and the king of [[Messenia]], [[Melanthus]].<ref \

(428/427) is based on a dubious interpretation of Diogenes Laertius, who \
says, \\\"When [Socrates] was gone, [Plato] joined [[Cratylus|Cratylus the \
Heracleitean]] and Hermogenes, who philosophized in the manner of \
[[Parmenides]]. Then, at twenty-eight, Hermodorus says, [Plato] went to \
[[Euclid of Megara|Euclides in Megara]].\\\" As [[Debra Nails]] argues, \
\\\"The text itself gives no reason to infer that Plato left immediately for \
Megara and implies the very opposite.\\\"{{sfn|Nails|2002|p=247}} In his \
''[[Seventh Letter (Plato)|Seventh Letter]]'', Plato notes that his coming of \
age coincided with the taking of power by the Thirty, remarking, \\\"But a \
youth under the age of twenty made himself a laughingstock if he attempted to \
enter the political arena.\\\" Thus, Nails dates Plato's birth to \
424/423.{{sfn|Nails|2002|p=246}}\\n\\nAccording to some accounts, Ariston \
tried to force his attentions on Perictione, but failed in his purpose; then \
the [[Twelve Olympians|god]] [[Apollo]] appeared to him in a vision, and as a \
result, Ariston left Perictione unmolested.<ref name=\\\"Ap1\\\">Apuleius, \

lips while he was sleeping: an augury of the sweetness of style in which he \
would discourse about philosophy.<ref>[[Cicero]], ''[[De Divinatione]]'', I, \

{{citeplato|Parmenides|126c}}</ref>\\n\\nIn contrast to reticence about \
himself, Plato often introduced his distinguished relatives into his \
dialogues, or referred to them with some precision: Charmides has a dialogue \
named after him; Critias speaks in both ''[[Charmides \
(dialogue)|Charmides]]'' and ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]''; and \
Adeimantus and Glaucon take prominent parts in the ''[[Republic \
(Plato)|Republic]]''.{{sfn|Guthrie|1986|p=11}} These and other references \
suggest a considerable amount of family pride and enable us to reconstruct \
Plato's [[family tree]]. According to Burnet, \\\"the opening scene of the \
''Charmides'' is a glorification of the whole [family] connection ... Plato's \
dialogues are not only a memorial to Socrates, but also the happier days of \
his own family.\\\"{{sfn|Kahn|2004|p=186}}\\n\\n====Name====\\nAccording to \
[[Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius]], the philosopher was named ''Aristocles'' \
({{lang|grc|\:1f08\[Rho]\[Iota]\[Sigma]\[Tau]\[Omicron]\[Kappa]\[Lambda]\:1fc6\
\[FinalSigma]}}) after his grandfather.{{sfn|La\[EDoubleDot]rtius|1925|loc=\
\[Section] 4}} It was common in Athenian society for boys to be named after \
grandfathers (or fathers). But there is only one inscriptional record of an \
Aristocles, an early Archon of Athens in 605/4 BC. There is no record of a \
line from Aristocles to Plato's father, Ariston. However, if Plato was not \
named after an ancestor named Plato (there is no record of one), then the \
origin of his renaming as ''Plato'' becomes a conundrum.<ref name=\\\"Sedley \

21\[Dash]22].</ref>\\n\\nThe sources of Diogenes account for this fact by \
claiming that his [[wrestling]] coach, Ariston of Argos, dubbed him \
''Platon'', meaning \\\"broad,\\\" on account of his robust figure<ref \
name=\\\"LaIV\\\">Diogenes Laertius, ''Life of Plato'', IV</ref> or that \
Plato derived his name from the breadth ({{lang|grc|\[Pi]\[Lambda]\[Alpha]\
\[Tau]\:03cd\[Tau]\[Eta]\[FinalSigma]}}, ''platyt\[EBar]s'') of his \
eloquence, or else because he was very wide \

{{harvnb|Notopoulos|1939|p=135}}</ref> Recently a scholar has argued that \

are known from Athens alone{{sfn|Guthrie|1986|loc=p. 12 (footnote)}}), the \
name does not occur in Plato's known family line. Another scholar, however, \
claims that \\\"there is good reason for not dismissing [the idea that \
Aristocles was Plato's given name] as a mere invention of his \
biographers\\\", noting how prevalent that account is in our sources.<ref \

called himself ''Platon'' is indisputable, but the origin of this naming must \
remain moot unless the record is made to yield more \

[[Sicily]], [[Egypt]] and [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]].{{sfn|McEvoy|1984}} Said \
to have returned to Athens at the age of forty, Plato founded one of the \
earliest known organized schools in Western Civilization on a plot of land in \
the Grove of Hecademus or Academus.{{sfn|Cairns|1961|p=xiii}} The [[Academy]] \
was a large enclosure of ground about six [[Stadion (unit of length)|stadia]] \
outside of Athens proper. One story is that the name of the Academy comes \
from the ancient hero, [[Academus]]; still another story is that the name \
came from a supposed former owner of the plot of land, an Athenian citizen \
whose name was (also) Academus; while yet another account is that it was \
named after a member of the army of [[Castor and Pollux]], an [[Regions of \
ancient Greece#Arcadia|Arcadian]] named Echedemus.{{sfn|Robinson|1827|p=16}} \
The Academy operated until it was destroyed by [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] in \
84 BC. Neoplatonists revived the Academy in the early 5th century but there \
was no institutional continuity with Plato's school, and it operated until \
529 AD, when it was closed by [[Justinian I]] of [[Byzantium]].<ref>Lindberg, \

nThroughout his later life, Plato became entangled with the politics of the \
city of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. According to Diogenes Laertius, Plato \
initially visited Syracuse while it was under the rule of [[Dionysius I of \
Syracuse|Dionysius]].{{sfn|Riginos|1976|p=73}} During this first trip \
Dionysius's brother-in-law, [[Dion of Syracuse]], became one of Plato's \
disciples, but the tyrant himself turned against Plato. Plato almost faced \
death, but he was sold into slavery. Then Anniceris<ref>Not to be confused \

twenty [[Mina (unit)|minas]],<ref>Diogenes Laertius, \

Dionysius's death, according to [[Seventh Letter (Plato)|Plato's ''Seventh \
Letter'']], Dion requested Plato return to Syracuse to tutor [[Dionysius II \
of Syracuse|Dionysius II]] and guide him to become a philosopher king. \
Dionysius II seemed to accept Plato's teachings, but he became suspicious of \
Dion, his uncle. Dionysius expelled Dion and kept Plato against his will. \
Eventually Plato left Syracuse. Dion would return to overthrow Dionysius and \
ruled Syracuse for a short time before being usurped by [[Calippus of \
Syracuse|Calippus]], a fellow disciple of Plato.\\n\\n===Death===\\nA variety \
of sources have given accounts of Plato's death. One story, based on a \
mutilated manuscript,{{sfn|Riginos|1976|p=194}} suggests Plato died in his \
bed, whilst a young [[Thracian]] girl played the flute to \
him.{{sfn|Schall|1996}} Another tradition suggests Plato died at a wedding \
feast. The account is based on Diogenes Laertius's reference to an account by \
Hermippus, a third-century Alexandrian.{{sfn|Riginos|1976|p=195}} According \
to [[Tertullian]], Plato simply died in his \
sleep.{{sfn|Riginos|1976|p=195}}\\n\\n==Intellectual influences on \
Plato==\\n===Pythagoras===\\n[[File:Kapitolinischer Pythagoras \
adjusted.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of Pythagoras based on traditional iconography \
at the Museum Capitolini, Rome.]]\\n{{See also|Pythagoreanism}}\\nAlthough \
Socrates influenced Plato directly as related in the dialogues, the influence \
of [[Pythagoras]] upon Plato also appears to have significant discussion in \
the philosophical literature. Pythagoras, or in a broader sense, the \
Pythagoreans, allegedly exercised an important influence on the work of \
Plato. According to [[R. M. Hare]], this influence consists of three points: \
(1) The [[Republic (Plato)|platonic Republic]] might be related to the idea \
of \\\"a tightly organized community of like-minded thinkers\\\", like the \
one established by Pythagoras in Croton. (2) There is evidence that Plato \
possibly took from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and, generally \
speaking, abstract thinking is a secure basis for philosophical thinking as \
well as \\\"for substantial theses in [[science]] and [[morals]]\\\". (3) \

problem}}\\n[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Socrates]] at \
the [[Louvre]].]]\\nThe precise relationship between Plato and Socrates \
remains an area of contention among scholars. Plato makes it clear in his \
[[Apology (Plato)|''Apology of Socrates'']] that he was a devoted young \
follower of Socrates. In that dialogue, Socrates is presented as mentioning \
Plato by name as one of those youths close enough to him to have been \
corrupted, if he were in fact guilty of corrupting the youth, and questioning \
why their fathers and brothers did not step forward to testify against him if \
he was indeed guilty of such a crime (33d\[Dash]34a). Later, Plato is \
mentioned along with Crito, Critobolus, and Apollodorus as offering to pay a \
fine of 30 [[Mina (unit)|minas]] on Socrates' behalf, in lieu of the death \
penalty proposed by [[Meletus]] (38b). In the ''[[Phaedo]]'', the title \
character lists those who were in attendance at the prison on Socrates' last \
day, explaining Plato's absence by saying, \\\"Plato was ill\\\". (''Phaedo'' \
59b)\\n\\nPlato never speaks in his own voice in his dialogues. In the \
[[Second Letter (Plato)|''Second Letter'']], it says, \\\"no writing of Plato \
exists or ever will exist, but those now said to be his are those of a \
Socrates become beautiful and new\\\" (341c); if the Letter is Plato's, the \
final qualification seems to call into question the dialogues' historical \
fidelity. In any case, [[Xenophon]] and [[Aristophanes]] seem to present a \
somewhat different portrait of Socrates from the one Plato paints. Some have \
called attention to the problem of taking Plato's Socrates to be his \
mouthpiece, given Socrates' reputation for irony and the dramatic nature of \
the dialogue form.{{sfn|Strauss|1964|pp=50\[Dash]51}}\\n\\nAristotle \
attributes a different doctrine with respect to [[Theory of forms|Forms]] to \
Plato and Socrates (''Metaphysics'' 987b1\[Dash]11). Aristotle suggests that \
Socrates' idea of forms can be discovered through investigation of the \
natural world, unlike Plato's Forms that exist beyond and outside the \
ordinary range of human understanding.\\n\\n==Plato's use of \
myth==\\n''Mythos'' and ''logos'' are terms that evolved along classical \
Greece history. In the times of [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]] (8th century BC) \
they were quite synonyms, and contained the meaning of ''tale or history''. \
Later came historians like Herodotus and Thucydides, as well as philosophers \
as Parmenides and other Presocratics that introduced a distinction between \
both terms, and mythos became more a ''nonverifiable account'', and logos a \
''rational account''.<ref>{{cite \

Plato|url=https://www.academia.edu/10450689/_Mythos_and_Logos_in_Plato_|\
publisher=Open University|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref>  Plato, being a \
disciple of Socrates, and a strong partisan of philosophy based on logos, it \
seems that should have avoided the use of myth-telling. Instead he made an \
abundant use of it. This fact has produced analytical and interpretative \
work, in order to clarify the reasons and purposes for that use.\\n\\nPlato, \
in general, distinguished between three types of myth.{{Ref label|D|d|none}} \
First there were the false myths, like those based on stories of gods subject \
to passions and sufferings, because reason teaches that God is perfect. Then \
came the myths based on true reasoning, and therefore also true. Finally \
there were those non verifiable because beyond of human reason, but \
containing some truth in them. Regarding the subjects of Plato's myths they \
are of two types, those dealing with the origin of the universe, and those \
about morals and the origin and fate of the soul.<ref>{{cite \

the main purpose for Plato in using myths was didactic. He considered that \
only a few people were capable or interested in following a reasoned \
philosophical discourse, but men in general are attracted by stories and \
tales. Consequently then, he used the myth to convey the conclusions of the \
philosophical reasoning. Some of Plato's myths were based in traditional \
ones, others were modifications of them, and finally he also invented \
altogether new myths.<ref>{{cite \

and experience, while holding a copy of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' in his \
hand. Plato holds his ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and gestures to the \
heavens, representing his belief in [[The Forms]].]]\\n\\n===Recurrent \
themes===\\nPlato often discusses the father-son relationship and the \
question of whether a father's interest in his sons has much to do with how \
well his sons turn out. In ancient Athens, a boy was socially located by his \
family identity, and Plato often refers to his characters in terms of their \
paternal and fraternal relationships. Socrates was not a family man, and saw \
himself as the son of his mother, who was apparently a midwife. A divine \
fatalist, Socrates mocks men who spent exorbitant fees on tutors and trainers \
for their sons, and repeatedly ventures the idea that good character is a \
gift from the gods. Plato's dialogue [[Crito]] reminds Socrates that orphans \
are at the mercy of chance, but Socrates is unconcerned. In the \
''Theaetetus'', he is found recruiting as a disciple a young man whose \
inheritance has been squandered. Socrates twice compares the relationship of \
the older man and his boy lover to the father-son relationship (''Lysis'' \
213a, ''Republic'' 3.403b), and in the ''Phaedo'', Socrates' disciples, \
towards whom he displays more concern than his biological sons, say they will \
feel \\\"fatherless\\\" when he is gone.\\n\\nIn several of Plato's \
dialogues, Socrates promulgates the idea that [[knowledge]] is a matter of \
recollection, and not of learning, observation, or study.{{sfn|Baird & \
Kaufmann|2008}} He maintains this view somewhat at his own expense, because \
in many dialogues, Socrates complains of his forgetfulness. Socrates is often \
found arguing that knowledge is not empirical, and that it comes from divine \
insight. In many middle period dialogues, such as the ''Phaedo'', \
''Republic'' and ''Phaedrus'' Plato advocates a belief in the immortality of \
the soul, and several dialogues end with long speeches imagining the \
[[afterlife]]. More than one dialogue contrasts knowledge and opinion, \
perception and [[reality]], [[nature]] and custom, and body and \
soul.\\n\\nSeveral dialogues tackle questions about art: Socrates says that \
poetry is inspired by the [[muses]], and is not rational. He speaks \
approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, \
eroticism, and dreaming) in the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]] \
''(265a\[Dash]c), and yet in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]'' wants \
to outlaw Homer's great poetry, and laughter as well. In ''[[Ion \
(dialogue)|Ion]]'', Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that \
he expresses in the ''Republic''. The dialogue ''Ion'' suggests that \
[[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible \
does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literature \
that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly \
interpreted.\\n\\nSocrates and his company of disputants had something to say \
on many subjects, including politics and art, religion and science, justice \
and medicine, virtue and vice, crime and punishment, pleasure and pain, \
rhetoric and rhapsody, human nature and sexuality, as well as love and \
wisdom.\\n\\n===Metaphysics===\\n{{Main article|Platonic realism}}\\n<!-- \
Socrates is a character in Plato's dialogues! -->\\n\\\"Platonism\\\" is a \
term coined by scholars to refer to the intellectual consequences of denying, \
as Plato's Socrates often does, the reality of the material world. In several \
dialogues, most notably the ''Republic'', Socrates inverts the common man's \
intuition about what is knowable and what is real. While most people take the \
objects of their senses to be real if anything is, Socrates is contemptuous \
of people who think that something has to be graspable in the hands to be \
real. In the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', he says such people \
are ''eu amousoi'' (\[CurlyEpsilon]\:1f56 \:1f04\[Mu]\[Omicron]\[Upsilon]\
\[Sigma]\[Omicron]\[Iota]), an expression that means literally, \\\"happily \
without the muses\\\" (''Theaetetus'' 156a). In other words, such people live \
without the divine inspiration that gives him, and people like him, access to \
higher insights about reality.\\n\\nSocrates' idea that reality is \
unavailable to those who use their senses is what puts him at odds with the \
common man, and with common sense. Socrates says that he who sees with his \
eyes is blind, and this idea is most famously captured in his [[Allegory of \
the Cave]], and more explicitly in his description of [[the divided line of \
Plato|the divided line]]. The Allegory of the Cave (begins ''Republic'' \
7.514a) is a paradoxical analogy wherein Socrates argues that the invisible \
world is the most intelligible (\\\"noeton\\\") and that the visible world \
(\\\"(h)oraton\\\") is the least knowable, and the most \
obscure.\\n\\nSocrates says in the ''Republic'' that people who take the \
sun-lit world of the senses to be good and real are living pitifully in a den \
of evil and ignorance. Socrates admits that few climb out of the den, or cave \
of ignorance, and those who do, not only have a terrible struggle to attain \
the heights, but when they go back down for a visit or to help other people \
up, they find themselves objects of scorn and ridicule.\\n\\nAccording to \
Socrates, physical objects and physical events are \\\"shadows\\\" of their \
ideal or perfect forms, and exist only to the extent that they instantiate \
the perfect versions of themselves. Just as shadows are temporary, \
inconsequential epiphenomena produced by physical objects, physical objects \
are themselves fleeting phenomena caused by more substantial causes, the \
ideals of which they are mere instances. For example, Socrates thinks that \
perfect justice exists (although it is not clear where) and his own trial \
would be a cheap copy of it.\\n\\nThe Allegory of the Cave (often said by \
scholars to represent Plato's own epistemology and metaphysics) is intimately \
connected to his political ideology (often said to also be Plato's own), that \
only people who have climbed out of the cave and cast their eyes on a vision \
of goodness are fit to rule. Socrates claims that the enlightened men of \
society must be forced from their divine contemplations and be compelled to \
run the city according to their lofty insights. Thus is born the idea of the \
\\\"[[philosopher king|philosopher-king]]\\\", the wise person who accepts \
the power thrust upon him by the people who are wise enough to choose a good \
master. This is the main thesis of Socrates in the ''Republic'', that the \
most wisdom the masses can muster is the wise choice of a ruler.<ref>{{cite \

and Interpretation  |website=Bachelor and Master |access-date=February 25, \
2017}}</ref>\\n\\n===Theory of Forms===\\n{{Main article|Theory of Forms}}\\n\
\\nThe theory of Forms (or theory of Ideas) typically refers to the belief \
that the material world as it seems to us is not the real world, but only an \
\\\"image\\\" or \\\"copy\\\" of the real world. In some of Plato's \
dialogues, this is expressed by Socrates, who spoke of forms in formulating \
[[Platonic realism|a solution]] to the [[problem of universals]]. The forms, \
according to Socrates, are [[archetype]]s or [[Abstraction|abstract]] \
representations of the many [[Type (metaphysics)|types]] of things, and \
[[property (metaphysics)|properties]] we feel and see around us, that can \
only be perceived by reason ({{lang|grc|\[Lambda]\[Omicron]\[Gamma]\[Iota]\
\[Kappa]\:03ae}}). (That is, they are [[Universal \
(metaphysics)|universals]].) In other words, Socrates was able to recognize \
two worlds: the apparent world, which constantly changes, and an unchanging \
and unseen world of forms, which may be the cause of what is \
apparent.\\n\\n===Epistemology===\\n{{Main article| Platonic \
epistemology}}\\n\\nMany have interpreted Plato as stating\[LongDash]even \
having been the first to write\[LongDash]that [[knowledge]] is [[justified \
true belief]], an influential view that informed future developments in \
epistemology.{{sfn|Fine|2003|p=5}} This interpretation is partly based on a \
reading of the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' wherein Plato argues \
that knowledge is distinguished from mere true belief by the knower having an \
\\\"account\\\" of the object of her or his true belief \
({{citeplato|Theaetetus|201c\[Dash]d}}). And this theory may again be seen in \
the ''Meno'', where it is suggested that true belief can be raised to the \
level of knowledge if it is bound with an account as to the question of \
\\\"why\\\" the object of the true belief is so \
({{citeplato|Meno|97d\[Dash]98a}}).{{sfn|McDowell|1973|p=230}} Many years \
later, [[Edmund Gettier]] famously demonstrated the problems of the justified \
true belief account of knowledge. That the modern theory of justified true \
belief as knowledge which Gettier addresses is equivalent to Plato's is \
accepted by some scholars but rejected by others.{{sfn|Fine|1979|p=366}} \
Plato himself also identified problems with the ''justified true belief'' \
definition in the ''Theaetetus'', concluding that justification (or an \
\\\"account\\\") would require knowledge of ''differentness'', meaning that \
the definition of knowledge is [[circular reasoning|circular]] \
({{citeplato|Theaetetus|210a\[Dash]b}}).{{sfn|McDowell|1973|p=256}}\\n\\\
nLater in the ''[[Meno (Plato)#Dialogue with Meno's slave|Meno]]'', Socrates \
uses a geometrical example to expound Plato's view that knowledge in this \
latter sense is acquired by [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|recollection]]. Socrates \
elicits a fact concerning a geometrical construction from a slave boy, who \
could not have otherwise known the fact (due to the slave boy's lack of \
education). The knowledge must be present, Socrates concludes, in an eternal, \
non-experiential form.\\n\\nIn other dialogues, the ''[[Sophist \
(dialogue)|Sophist]]'', ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]'', ''[[Republic \
(dialogue)|Republic]]'', and the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', \
Plato himself associates knowledge with the apprehension of unchanging Forms \
and their relationships to one another (which he calls \\\"expertise\\\" in \
[[Dialectic]]), including through the processes of ''collection'' and \
''division''.{{sfn|Taylor|2011|pp=176\[Dash]187}} More explicitly, Plato \
himself argues in the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' that knowledge is \
always proportionate to the realm from which it is gained. In other words, if \
one derives one's account of something experientially, because the world of \
sense is in flux, the views therein attained will be mere opinions. And \
opinions are characterized by a lack of necessity and stability. On the other \
hand, if one derives one's account of something by way of the non-sensible \
forms, because these forms are unchanging, so too is the account derived from \
them. That apprehension of forms is required for knowledge may be taken to \
cohere with Plato's theory in the ''Theaetetus'' and \
''Meno''.{{sfn|Lee|2011|p=432}} Indeed, the apprehension of Forms may be at \
the base of the \\\"account\\\" required for justification, in that it offers \
[[Foundationalism|foundational]] knowledge which itself needs no account, \
thereby avoiding an [[infinite \
regression]].{{sfn|Taylor|2011|p=189}}\\n\\n===The state===\\n{{main \
article|The Republic (Plato)}}\\n[[File:POxy3679 Parts Plato \
Republic.jpg|thumb|[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]], with fragment of Plato's \
''Republic'']]\\nSome of Plato's most famous doctrines are contained in the \
''Republic'' as well as in the ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' and the \
''Statesman''. Because these doctrines are not spoken directly by Plato and \
vary between dialogues, they cannot be straightforwardly assumed as \
representing Plato's own views. \\n\\nSocrates asserts that societies have a \
tripartite class structure corresponding to the appetite/spirit/reason \
structure of the individual soul. The appetite/spirit/reason are analogous to \
the castes of \
society.{{sfn|Bl\[ODoubleDot]ssner|2007|pp=345\[Dash]349}}\\n\\n* \
''Productive'' (Workers)&nbsp;\[Dash] the labourers, carpenters, plumbers, \
masons, merchants, farmers, ranchers, etc. These correspond to the \
\\\"appetite\\\" part of the soul.\\n* ''Protective'' (Warriors or \
Guardians)&nbsp;\[Dash] those who are adventurous, strong and brave; in the \
armed forces. These correspond to the \\\"spirit\\\" part of the soul.\\n* \
''Governing'' (Rulers or Philosopher Kings)&nbsp;\[Dash] those who are \
intelligent, rational, self-controlled, in love with wisdom, well suited to \
make decisions for the community. These correspond to the \\\"reason\\\" part \
of the soul and are very few.\\n\\nIn the [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], \
Socrates locates the parts of the soul within the human body: Reason is \
located in the head, spirit in the top third of the [[torso]], and the \
appetite in the middle third of the torso, down to the [[navel]].<ref>Plato, \
{{citeplato|Timaeus|44d}} & \
{{Citeplato|Timaeus|70}}</ref>{{sfn|Dorter|2006|p=360}}\\n\\nAccording to \
this model, the principles of [[Athenian democracy]] (as it existed in his \
day) are rejected as only a few are fit to rule. Instead of rhetoric and \
persuasion, Socrates says reason and wisdom should govern. As Socrates puts \
it:\\n\\n: \\\"Until philosophers rule as kings or those who are now called \
kings and leading men genuinely and adequately philosophise, that is, until \
political power and philosophy entirely coincide, while the many natures who \
at present pursue either one exclusively are forcibly prevented from doing \
so, cities will have no rest from evils,... nor, I think, will the human \
race.\\\" (''Republic'' 473c\[Dash]d)\\n[[File:Plato i sin akademi, av Carl \
Johan Wahlbom (ur Svenska Familj-Journalen).png|thumb|Plato in his academy, \
drawing after a painting by Swedish painter Carl Johan \
Wahlbom]]\\n\\nSocrates describes these \\\"philosopher kings\\\" as \
\\\"those who love the sight of truth\\\" (''Republic'' 475c) and supports \
the idea with the analogy of a captain and his ship or a doctor and his \
medicine. According to him, sailing and health are not things that everyone \
is qualified to practice by nature. A large part of the ''Republic'' then \
addresses how the educational system should be set up to produce these \
philosopher kings.\\n\\nIn addition, the ideal city is used as an image to \
illuminate the state of one's soul, or the [[Free will|will]], [[reason]], \
and [[Interpersonal attraction|desire]]s combined in the human body. Socrates \
is attempting to make an image of a rightly ordered human, and then later \
goes on to describe the different kinds of humans that can be observed, from \
tyrants to lovers of money in various kinds of cities. The ideal city is not \
promoted, but only used to magnify the different kinds of individual humans \
and the state of their soul. However, the [[philosopher king]] image was used \
by many after Plato to justify their personal political beliefs. The \
philosophic soul according to Socrates has reason, will, and desires united \
in virtuous harmony. A philosopher has the [[moderate]] love for [[wisdom]] \
and the [[courage]] to act according to wisdom. Wisdom is [[knowledge]] about \
the [[Goodness and value theory|Good]] or the right relations between all \
that [[Existence|exist]]s.\\n\\nWherein it concerns states and rulers, \
Socrates asks which is better\[LongDash]a bad democracy or a country reigned \
by a tyrant. He argues that it is better to be ruled by a bad tyrant, than by \
a bad democracy (since here all the people are now responsible for such \
actions, rather than one individual committing many bad deeds.) This is \
emphasised within the ''Republic'' as Socrates describes the event of mutiny \
on board a ship.<ref>Plato, {{citeplato|Republic|488}}</ref> Socrates \
suggests the ship's crew to be in line with the democratic rule of many and \
the captain, although inhibited through ailments, the tyrant. Socrates' \
description of this event is parallel to that of democracy within the state \
and the inherent problems that arise. \\n\\nAccording to Socrates, a state \
made up of different kinds of souls will, overall, decline from an \
[[aristocracy]] (rule by the best) to a [[timocracy]] (rule by the \
honorable), then to an [[oligarchy]] (rule by the few), then to a \
[[democracy]] (rule by the people), and finally to [[tyranny]] (rule by one \
person, rule by a tyrant).{{sfn|Bl\[ODoubleDot]ssner|2007|p=350}} Aristocracy \
in the sense of government (politeia) is advocated in Plato's Republic. This \
regime is ruled by a [[philosopher king]], and thus is grounded on wisdom and \
reason. \\n\\nThe aristocratic state, and the man whose nature corresponds to \
it, are the objects of Plato's analyses throughout much of the ''Republic'', \
as opposed to the other four types of states/men, who are discussed later in \
his work. In Book VIII, Socrates states in order the other four imperfect \
societies with a description of the state's structure and individual \
character. In timocracy the ruling class is made up primarily of those with a \
warrior-like character.<ref>{{citeplato|Republic|550b}}</ref> Oligarchy is \
made up of a society in which wealth is the criterion of merit and the \
wealthy are in control.<ref>{{citeplato|Republic|554a}}</ref> In democracy, \
the state bears resemblance to ancient Athens with traits such as equality of \
political opportunity and freedom for the individual to do as he \
likes.<ref>{{citeplato|Republic|561a\[Dash]b}}</ref> Democracy then \
degenerates into tyranny from the conflict of [[rich and poor]]. It is \
characterized by an undisciplined society existing in chaos, where the tyrant \
rises as popular champion leading to the formation of his private army and \
the growth of oppression.<ref>{{citeplato|Republic|571a}}</ref>{{sfn|Bl\

\[CurlyPhi]\[Alpha] \[Delta]\:03cc\[Gamma]\[Mu]\[Alpha]\[Tau]\[Alpha]}}\\\" \
literally means ''unwritten doctrines'' and it stands for the most \
fundamental metaphysical teaching of Plato, which he disclosed only orally, \
and some say only to his most trusted fellows, and which he may have kept \
secret from the public. The importance of the unwritten doctrines does not \
seem to have been seriously questioned before the 19th century.\\n\\nA reason \
for not revealing it to everyone is partially discussed in ''[[Phaedrus \
(dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' (276 c) where Plato criticizes the written \
transmission of knowledge as faulty, favoring instead the spoken [[logos]]: \
\\\"he who has knowledge of the just and the good and beautiful ... will not, \
when in earnest, write them in ink, sowing them through a pen with words, \
which cannot defend themselves by argument and cannot teach the truth \
effectually.\\\" The same argument is repeated in Plato's ''[[Seventh Letter \
(Plato)|Seventh Letter]]'' (344 c): \\\"every serious man in dealing with \
really serious subjects carefully avoids writing.\\\" In the same letter he \
writes (341 c): \\\"I can certainly declare concerning all these writers who \
claim to know the subjects that I seriously study ... there does not exist, \
nor will there ever exist, any treatise of mine dealing therewith.\\\" Such \
secrecy is necessary in order not \\\"to expose them to unseemly and \
degrading treatment\\\" (344 d).\\n\\nIt is, however, said that Plato once \
disclosed this knowledge to the public in his lecture ''On the Good'' \
({{lang|grc|\[CapitalPi]\[CurlyEpsilon]\[Rho]\:1f76 \[Tau]\:1f00\[Gamma]\
\[Alpha]\[Theta]\[Omicron]\:1fe6}}), in which the Good ({{lang|grc|\[Tau]\
\:1f78 \:1f00\[Gamma]\[Alpha]\[Theta]\:03cc\[Nu]}}) is identified with the \
One (the Unity, {{lang|grc|\[Tau]\:1f78 \:1f15\[Nu]}}), the fundamental \
ontological principle. The content of this lecture has been transmitted by \
several witnesses. [[Aristoxenus]] describes the event in the following \
words: \\\"Each came expecting to learn something about the things that are \
generally considered good for men, such as wealth, good health, physical \
strength, and altogether a kind of wonderful happiness. But when the \
mathematical demonstrations came, including numbers, geometrical figures and \
astronomy, and finally the statement Good is One seemed to them, I imagine, \
utterly unexpected and strange; hence some belittled the matter, while others \
rejected it.\\\"<ref>''Elementa harmonica'' II, 30\[Dash]31; quoted in \
{{harvnb|Gaiser|1980|p=5}}.</ref> [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] quotes \
[[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], who states that \\\"according to Plato, the \
first principles of everything, including the Forms themselves are One and \
Indefinite Duality ({{lang|grc|\:1f21 \:1f00\:03cc\[Rho]\[Iota]\[Sigma]\[Tau]\
\[Omicron]\[FinalSigma] \[Delta]\[Upsilon]\:03ac\[FinalSigma]}}), which he \
called Large and Small ({{lang|grc|\[Tau]\:1f78 \[Mu]\:03ad\[Gamma]\[Alpha] \
\[Kappa]\[Alpha]\:1f76 \[Tau]\:1f78 \
\[Mu]\[Iota]\[Kappa]\[Rho]\:03cc\[Nu]}})\\\", and Simplicius reports as well \
that \\\"one might also learn this from Speusippus and Xenocrates and the \
others who were present at Plato's lecture on the Good\\\".<ref name=\\\":0\\\
\">see {{harvnb|Tar\[AAcute]n|1981|p=226}}.</ref>\\n\\nTheir account is in \
full agreement with Aristotle's description of Plato's metaphysical doctrine. \
In ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' he writes: \\\"Now since the \
Forms are the causes of everything else, he [i.e. Plato] supposed that their \
elements are the elements of all things. Accordingly the material principle \
is the Great and Small [i.e. the Dyad], and the essence is the One \
({{lang|grc|\[Tau]\:1f78 \:1f15\[Nu]}}), since the numbers are derived from \
the Great and Small by participation in the One\\\" (987 b). \\\"From this \
account it is clear that he only employed two causes: that of the essence, \
and the material cause; for the Forms are the cause of the essence in \
everything else, and the One is the cause of it in the Forms. He also tells \
us what the material substrate is of which the Forms are predicated in the \
case of sensible things, and the One in that of the Forms\[LongDash]that it \
is this the duality (the Dyad, {{lang|grc|\:1f21 \[Delta]\[Upsilon]\:03ac\
\[FinalSigma]}}), the Great and Small ({{lang|grc|\[Tau]\:1f78 \[Mu]\:03ad\
\[Gamma]\[Alpha] \[Kappa]\[Alpha]\:1f76 \[Tau]\:1f78 \[Mu]\[Iota]\[Kappa]\
\[Rho]\:03cc\[Nu]}}). Further, he assigned to these two elements respectively \
the causation of good and of evil\\\" (988 a).\\n\\nThe most important aspect \
of this interpretation of Plato's metaphysics is the continuity between his \
teaching and the neoplatonic interpretation of [[Plotinus]]<ref>[[Plotinus]] \
describes this in the last part of his final ''[[Enneads|Ennead]]'' (VI, 9) \
entitled ''On the Good, or the One'' ({{lang|grc|\[CapitalPi]\[CurlyEpsilon]\
\[Rho]\:1f76 \[Tau]\:1f00\[Gamma]\[Alpha]\[Theta]\[Omicron]\:1fe6 \:1f22 \
\[Tau]\[Omicron]\:1fe6 \:1f11\[Nu]\:03cc\[FinalSigma]}}). Jens Halfwassen \
states in [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2006/2006-08-16.html ''Der Aufstieg \
zum Einen'] (2006) that \\\"Plotinus' ontology\[LongDash]which should be \
called Plotinus' [[henology]]\[LongDash]is a rather accurate philosophical \
renewal and continuation of Plato's unwritten doctrine, i.e. the doctrine \
rediscovered by Kr\[ADoubleDot]mer and Gaiser.\\\"</ref> or [[Ficino]]<ref>In \
one of his letters (Epistolae 1612) [[Ficino]] writes: \\\"The main goal of \
the divine Plato ... is to show one principle of things, which he called the \
One ({{lang|grc|\[Tau]\:1f78 \:1f15\[Nu]}})\\\", cf. \
{{harvnb|Montoriola|1926|p=147}}.</ref> which has been considered erroneous \
by many but may in fact have been directly influenced by oral transmission of \
Plato's doctrine. A modern scholar who recognized the importance of the \
unwritten doctrine of Plato was [[Heinrich Gomperz]] who described it in his \
speech during the 7th [[International Congress of Philosophy]] in \
1930.{{sfn|Gomperz|1931}} All the sources related to the {{lang|grc|\:1f04\
\[Gamma]\[Rho]\[Alpha]\[CurlyPhi]\[Alpha] \[Delta]\:03cc\[Gamma]\[Mu]\[Alpha]\
\[Tau]\[Alpha]}} have been collected by Konrad Gaiser and published as \
''Testimonia Platonica''.{{sfn|Gaiser|1998}} These sources have subsequently \
been interpreted by scholars from the German ''T\[UDoubleDot]bingen School of \
interpretation'' such as Hans Joachim Kr\[ADoubleDot]mer or Thomas A. Szlez\
\[AAcute]k.<ref>For a brief description of the problem see for example \
{{harvnb|Gaiser|1980}}. A more detailed analysis is given by {{harvnb|Kr\
\[ADoubleDot]mer|1990}}. Another description is by {{harvnb|Reale|1997}} and \
{{harvnb|Reale|1990}}. A thorough analysis of the consequences of such an \
approach is given by {{harvnb|Szlezak|1999}}. Another supporter of this \
interpretation is the German philosopher [[Karl Albert]], cf. \
{{harvnb|Albert|1980}} or {{harvnb|Albert|1996}}. [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] is \
also sympathetic towards it, cf. {{harvnb|Grondin|2010}} and \
{{harvnb|Gadamer|1980}}. Gadamer's final position on the subject is stated in \
{{harvnb|Gadamer|1997}}.</ref>\\n\\n===Dialectic===\\nThe role of \
[[dialectic]] in Plato's thought is contested but there are two main \
interpretations: a type of reasoning and a method of \
intuition.{{sfn|Blackburn|1996|p=104}} [[Simon Blackburn]] adopts the first, \
saying that Plato's dialectic is \\\"the process of eliciting the truth by \
means of questions aimed at opening out what is already implicitly known, or \
at exposing the contradictions and muddles of an opponent's \
position.\\\"{{sfn|Blackburn|1996|p=104}} A similar interpretation has been \
put forth by Louis Hartz, who suggests that elements of the dialectic are \
borrowed from [[Hegel]].<ref>Hartz, Louis. 1984. ''A Synthesis of World \
History''. Zurich: Humanity Press</ref> According to this view, opposing \
arguments improve upon each other, and prevailing opinion is shaped by the \
synthesis of many conflicting ideas over time. Each new idea exposes a flaw \
in the accepted model, and the epistemological substance of the debate \
continually approaches the truth. Hartz's is a teleological interpretation at \
the core, in which philosophers will ultimately exhaust the available body of \
knowledge and thus reach \\\"the end of history.\\\" [[Karl Popper]], on the \
other hand, claims that dialectic is the art of intuition for \\\"visualising \
the divine originals, the Forms or Ideas, of unveiling the Great Mystery \
behind the common man's everyday world of \
appearances.\\\"{{sfn|Popper|1962|p=133}}\\n\\n==Dialogues{{Anchor|Works|\
Plato's dialogues}}==\\n{{see also|Stephanus pagination}}\\nThirty-five \
dialogues and thirteen letters (the [[Epistles (Plato)|''Epistles'']]) have \
traditionally been ascribed to Plato, though modern scholarship doubts the \
authenticity of at least some of these. Plato's writings have been published \
in several fashions; this has led to several conventions regarding the naming \
and referencing of Plato's texts.\\n\\nThe usual system for making unique \
references to sections of the text by Plato derives from a 16th-century \
edition of Plato's works by [[Henri Estienne|Henricus Stephanus]]. An \
overview of Plato's writings according to this system can be found in the \
[[Stephanus pagination]] article.\\n\\n[[File:Timaeus stephanus pages 32 \
33.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Volume 3, pages 32\[Dash]33, of the 1578 Stephanus \
edition of Plato, showing a passage of ''Timaeus'' with the Latin translation \
and notes of [[Jean de Serres]]]]\\nOne tradition regarding the arrangement \
of Plato's texts is according to [[tetralogy|tetralogies]]. This scheme is \
ascribed by Diogenes Laertius to an ancient scholar and court astrologer to \
[[Tiberius]] named [[Thrasyllus of Mendes|Thrasyllus]].\\n\\nThe works are \

''Middle'', and ''Late'' period.<ref>CDC Reeve (Delta Kappa Epsilon \

following works were transmitted under Plato's name, most of them already \
considered spurious in antiquity, and so were not included by Thrasyllus in \
his tetralogical arrangement. These works are labelled as ''Notheuomenoi'' \
(\\\"spurious\\\") or ''Apocrypha''.\\n* ''[[Axiochus \

knows the exact order Plato's dialogues were written in, nor the extent to \
which some might have been later revised and rewritten. A significant \
distinction of the early Plato and the later Plato has been offered by \
scholars such as E.R. Dodds and has been summarized by Harold Bloom in his \
book titled ''Agon'': \\\"E.R. Dodds is the classical scholar whose writings \
most illuminated the Hellenic descent (in) ''The Greeks and the Irrational'' \
[...] In his chapter on Plato and the Irrational Soul [...] Dodds traces \
Plato's spiritual evolution from the pure rationalist of the ''Protagoras'' \
to the transcendental psychologist, influenced by the Pythagoreans and \
Orphics, of the later works culminating in the \
''Laws''.\\\"{{sfn|Bloom|1982|p=5}}\\n\\n[[Lewis Campbell (classicist)|Lewis \
Campbell]] was the first{{sfn|Burnet|1928b|p=9}} to make exhaustive use of \
[[stylometry]] to prove objectively that the ''Critias'', ''Timaeus'', \
''Laws'', ''Philebus'', ''Sophist'', and ''Statesman'' were all clustered \
together as a group, while the ''Parmenides'', ''Phaedrus'', ''Republic'', \
and ''Theaetetus'' belong to a separate group, which must be earlier (given \
Aristotle's statement in his ''Politics''<ref>Aristotle, ''Politics'' \
[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058&\
layout=&loc=2.1264b 1264b24-27].</ref> that the ''Laws'' was written after \
the ''Republic''; cf. Diogenes Laertius ''Lives'' 3.37). What is remarkable \
about Campbell's conclusions is that, in spite of all the stylometric studies \
that have been conducted since his time, perhaps the only chronological fact \
about Plato's works that can now be said to be ''proven'' by stylometry is \
the fact that ''Critias'', ''Timaeus'', ''Laws'', ''Philebus'', ''Sophist'', \
and ''Statesman'' are the latest of Plato's dialogues, the others \
earlier.{{sfn|Cooper|1997|p=xiv}}\\n\\nIncreasingly in the most recent Plato \
scholarship, writers are skeptical of the notion that the order of Plato's \
writings can be established with any precision,<ref>{{harvnb|Kraut|2013}}; \
{{harvnb|Schofield|2002}}; and {{harvnb|Rowe|2006}}.</ref> though Plato's \
works are still often characterized as falling at least roughly into three \
groups.<ref>[[#{{harvid|Brickhouse|Smith}}|Brickhouse & Smith]].</ref> The \
following represents one relatively common such division.<ref>See \
{{harvnb|Guthrie|1986}}; {{harvnb|Vlastos|1991}}; {{harvnb|Penner|1992}}; \
{{harvnb|Kahn|1996}}; {{harvnb|Fine|1999b}}.</ref> It should, however, be \
kept in mind that many of the positions in the ordering are still highly \
disputed, and also that the very notion that Plato's dialogues can or should \
be \\\"ordered\\\" is by no means universally accepted.\\n\\nAmong those who \
classify the dialogues into periods of composition, Socrates figures in all \
of the \\\"early dialogues\\\" and they are considered the most faithful \
representations of the historical Socrates.{{sfn|Dodds|2004}} They include \
''The Apology of Socrates'', ''Charmides'', ''Crito'', ''Euthyphro'', \
''Ion'', ''Laches'', ''Lesser Hippias'', ''Lysis'', ''Menexenus'', and \
''Protagoras'' (often considered one of the last of the \\\"early dialogues\\\
\"). Three dialogues are often considered \\\"transitional\\\" or \
\\\"pre-middle\\\": ''Euthydemus'', ''Gorgias'', and ''Meno''.\\n\\nWhereas \
those classified as \\\"early dialogues\\\" often conclude in [[aporia]], the \
so-called \\\"middle dialogues\\\" provide more clearly stated positive \
teachings that are often ascribed to Plato such as the theory of Forms. These \
dialogues include ''Cratylus'', ''Phaedo'', ''Phaedrus'', ''Republic'', \
''Symposium'', ''Parmenides'', and ''Theaetetus''. Proponents of dividing the \
dialogues into periods often consider the ''Parmenides'' and ''Theaetetus'' \
to come late in this period and be transitional to the next, as they seem to \
treat the theory of Forms critically (''Parmenides'') or only indirectly \
(''Theaetetus'').{{sfn|Brandwood|1990|p=251}} Ritter's stylometric analysis \
places ''Phaedrus'' as probably after ''Theaetetus'' and \
''Parmenides'',{{sfn|Brandwood|1990|p=77}} although it does not relate to the \
theory of Forms in the same way. The first book of the ''Republic'' is often \
thought to have been written significantly earlier than the rest of the work, \
although possibly having undergone revisions when the later books were \
attached to it.{{sfn|Brandwood|1990|p=251}}\\n\\nThe remaining dialogues are \
classified as \\\"late\\\" and are generally agreed to be difficult and \
challenging pieces of philosophy. This grouping is the only one proven by \
stylometric analysis.{{sfn|Cooper|1997|p=xiv}} While looked to for Plato's \\\
\"mature\\\" answers to the questions posed by his earlier works, those \
answers are difficult to discern. Some scholars{{sfn|Dodds|2004}} indicate \
that the theory of Forms is absent from the late dialogues, its having been \
refuted in the ''Parmenides'', but there isn't total consensus that the \
''Parmenides'' actually refutes the theory of Forms.{{sfn|Meinwald|1991}} The \
so-called \\\"late dialogues\\\" include ''Critias'', ''Laws'', ''Philebus'', \
''Sophist'', ''Statesman'', and \
''Timaeus''.{{sfn|Dodds|2004}}\\n\\n===Narration of the dialogues===\\nPlato \
never presents himself as a participant in any of the dialogues, and with the \
exception of the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', there is no suggestion that \
he heard any of the dialogues firsthand. Some dialogues have no narrator but \
have a pure \\\"dramatic\\\" form (examples: ''[[Meno]]'', ''[[Gorgias \
(dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]'', ''[[Crito]]'', \
''[[Euthyphro]]''), some dialogues are narrated by Socrates, wherein he \
speaks in first person (examples: ''[[Lysis (dialogue)|Lysis]]'', \
''[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]'', ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''). \
One dialogue, ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', begins in dramatic \
form but quickly proceeds to Socrates' narration of a conversation he had \
previously with the sophist for whom the dialogue is named; this narration \
continues uninterrupted till the dialogue's end.\\n[[File:Anselm Feuerbach - \
Das Gastmahl. Nach Platon (zweite Fassung) - Google Art \
Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Painting of a scene from Plato's ''[[Symposium \
(Plato)|Symposium]]'' ([[Anselm Feuerbach]], 1873)]]\\nTwo dialogues \
''Phaedo'' and ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' also begin in dramatic \
form but then proceed to virtually uninterrupted narration by followers of \
Socrates. ''Phaedo'', an account of Socrates' final conversation and hemlock \
drinking, is narrated by Phaedo to Echecrates in a foreign city not long \
after the execution took place.<ref>\\\"The time is not long after the death \
of Socrates; for the Pythagoreans [Echecrates & co.] have not heard any \
details yet\\\" ({{harvnb|Burnet|1911|p=5}}).</ref> The ''Symposium'' is \
narrated by Apollodorus, a Socratic disciple, apparently to Glaucon. \
Apollodorus assures his listener that he is recounting the story, which took \
place when he himself was an infant, not from his own memory, but as \
remembered by Aristodemus, who told him the story years ago.\\n\\nThe \
''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' is a peculiar case: a dialogue in \
dramatic form embedded within another dialogue in dramatic form. In the \
beginning of the ''Theaetetus'' (142c\[Dash]143b), [[Euclid of \
Megara|Euclides]] says that he compiled the conversation from notes he took \
based on what Socrates told him of his conversation with the title character. \
The rest of the ''Theaetetus'' is presented as a \\\"book\\\" written in \
dramatic form and read by one of Euclides' slaves (143c). Some scholars take \
this as an indication that Plato had by this date wearied of the narrated \
form.{{sfn|Burnet|1928a|loc=\[Section]177}} With the exception of the \
''Theaetetus'', Plato gives no explicit indication as to how these orally \
transmitted conversations came to be written down.\\n\\n===Trial of \
Socrates===\\n{{Main article|Trial of Socrates}}\\nThe trial of Socrates is \
the central, unifying event of Plato's dialogues. Because of this, \
''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' is among the most frequently read of his \
works. In the ''Apology'', Socrates tries to dismiss rumors that he is a \
[[sophism|sophist]] and defends himself against charges of disbelief in the \
gods and corruption of the young. Socrates insists that long-standing slander \
will be the real cause of his demise, and says the legal charges are \
essentially false. Socrates famously denies being wise, and explains how his \
life as a philosopher was launched by the [[Oracle at Delphi]]. He says that \
his quest to resolve the riddle of the oracle put him at odds with his fellow \
man, and that this is the reason he has been mistaken for a menace to the \
city-state of Athens.\\n\\nIf Plato's important dialogues do not refer to \
Socrates' execution explicitly, they allude to it, or use characters or \
themes that play a part in it. Five dialogues foreshadow the trial: In the \
''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' (210d) and the ''[[Euthyphro]]'' (2a\
\[Dash]b) Socrates tells people that he is about to face corruption charges. \
In the ''[[Meno]]'' (94e\[Dash]95a), one of the men who brings legal charges \
against Socrates, [[Anytus]], warns him about the trouble he may get into if \
he does not stop criticizing important people. In the ''[[Gorgias]]'', \
Socrates says that his trial will be like a doctor prosecuted by a cook who \
asks a jury of children to choose between the doctor's bitter medicine and \
the cook's tasty treats (521e\[Dash]522a). In the ''[[Republic \
(Plato)|Republic]]'' (7.517e), Socrates explains why an enlightened man \
(presumably himself) will stumble in a courtroom situation. The ''Apology'' \
is Socrates' defense speech, and the ''[[Crito]]'' and ''Phaedo'' take place \
in prison after the conviction. In the ''[[Protagoras]]'', Socrates is a \
guest at the home of [[Callias III|Callias]], son of [[Hipponicus]], a man \
whom Socrates disparages in the ''Apology'' as having wasted a great amount \
of money on sophists' fees.\\n\\n===Unity and diversity of the \
dialogues===\\nTwo other important dialogues, the ''[[Symposium \
(Plato)|Symposium]]'' and the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]'', are linked \
to the main storyline by characters. In the ''Apology'' (19b, c), Socrates \
says [[Aristophanes]] slandered him in a comic play, and blames him for \
causing his bad reputation, and ultimately, his death. In the ''Symposium'', \
the two of them are drinking together with other friends. The character \
Phaedrus is linked to the main story line by character (Phaedrus is also a \
participant in the ''Symposium'' and the ''Protagoras'') and by theme (the \
philosopher as divine emissary, etc.) The ''Protagoras'' is also strongly \
linked to the ''Symposium'' by characters: all of the formal speakers at the \
''Symposium'' (with the exception of Aristophanes) are present at the home of \
Callias in that dialogue. [[Charmides]] and his guardian [[Critias]] are \
present for the discussion in the ''Protagoras''. Examples of characters \
crossing between dialogues can be further multiplied. The ''Protagoras'' \
contains the largest gathering of Socratic associates.\\n\\nIn the dialogues \
Plato is most celebrated and admired for, Socrates is concerned with human \
and political virtue, has a distinctive personality, and friends and enemies \
who \\\"travel\\\" with him from dialogue to dialogue. This is not to say \
that Socrates is consistent: a man who is his friend in one dialogue may be \
an adversary or subject of his mockery in another. For example, Socrates \
praises the wisdom of [[Euthyphro (prophet)|Euthyphro]] many times in the \
''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', but makes him look like a fool in the \
''[[Euthyphro]]''. He disparages sophists generally, and [[Prodicus]] \
specifically in the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', whom he also slyly jabs \
in the ''Cratylus'' for charging the hefty fee of fifty [[drachma]]s for a \
course on language and grammar. However, Socrates tells Theaetetus in his \
[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|namesake dialogue]] that he admires Prodicus and has \
directed many pupils to him. Socrates' ideas are also not consistent within \
or between or among dialogues.\\n\\n===Platonic scholarship===\\n[[File:Herma \
of Plato - 0042MC.jpg|thumb|right|\\\"The safest general characterisation of \
the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of \
footnotes to Plato.\\\" (Alfred North Whitehead, ''[[Process and Reality]]'', \
1929).]]\\n\\nAlthough their popularity has fluctuated over the years, the \
works of Plato have never been without readers since the time they were \
written.{{sfn|Cooper|1997|p=vii}} Plato's thought is often compared with that \
of his most famous student, Aristotle, whose reputation during the Western \
[[Middle Ages]] so completely eclipsed that of Plato that the \
[[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophers referred to Aristotle as \\\"the \
Philosopher\\\". However, in the [[Byzantine Empire]], the study of Plato \
continued.\\n\\nThe only Platonic work known to western scholarship was \
Timaeus, until translations were made at a time post the fall of \
[[Constantinople]], which occurred during 1453,<ref>C. U. M. Smith - \

[Retrieved 2015-06-27]</ref> [[George Gemistos Plethon]] brought Plato's \
original writings from Constantinople in the century of its fall. It is \
believed that Plethon passed a copy of the Dialogues to [[Cosimo de' Medici]] \
when in 1438 the [[Council of Ferrara]], called to unify the Greek and Latin \
Churches, was adjourned to Florence, where Plethon then lectured on the \
relation and differences of Plato and Aristotle, and fired Cosimo with his \
enthusiasm;{{sfn|Lackner|2001|p=21}} Cosimo would supply [[Marsilio Ficino]] \
with Plato's text for translation to Latin. During the early Islamic era, \
[[Iran|Persian]] and Arab scholars translated much of Plato into Arabic and \
wrote [[Close reading|commentaries]] and interpretations on Plato's, \
Aristotle's and other Platonist philosophers' works (see [[Al-Farabi]], \
[[Avicenna]], [[Averroes]], [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]]). Many of these comments on \
Plato were translated from Arabic into Latin and as such influenced Medieval \
scholastic philosophers.<ref>See {{harvnb|Burrell|1998}} and \
{{harvnb|Hasse|2002|pp=33\[Dash]45}}.</ref>\\n\\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], \
with the general resurgence of interest in classical civilization, knowledge \
of Plato's philosophy would become widespread again in the West. Many of the \
greatest early modern scientists and artists who broke with [[Scholasticism]] \
and fostered the flowering of the Renaissance, with the support of the \
Plato-inspired [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo]] (grandson of Cosimo), saw \
Plato's philosophy as the basis for progress in the arts and sciences. His \
political views, too, were well-received: the vision of wise \
philosopher-kings of the ''Republic'' matched the views set out in works such \
as [[Niccol\[OGrave] Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]''. More \
problematic was Plato's belief in [[metempsychosis]], transmigration of the \
soul, as well as his ethical views (on [[polyamory]] and [[euthanasia]] in \
particular), which did not match those of Christianity. It was Plethon's \
student [[Basilios Bessarion|Bessarion]] who reconciled Plato with Christian \
theology, arguing that Plato's views were only ideals, unattainable due to \
the [[fall of man]].<ref>{{Cite web |first=Jonathan |last=Harris |year=2002 \

restored, and at least on par with Aristotle's. Notable Western philosophers \
have continued to draw upon Plato's work since that time. Plato's influence \
has been especially strong in mathematics and the sciences. He helped to \
distinguish between [[pure mathematics|pure]] and [[applied mathematics]] by \
widening the gap between \\\"arithmetic\\\", now called [[number theory]] and \
\\\"logistic\\\", now called [[arithmetic]]. He regarded \\\"logistic\\\" as \
appropriate for business men and men of war who \\\"must learn the art of \
numbers or he will not know how to array his troops,\\\" while \\\"arithmetic\
\\\" was appropriate for philosophers \\\"because he has to arise out of the \
sea of change and lay hold of true being.\\\"<ref>{{harvnb|Boyer|1991|p=86}}: \
'Plato is important in the history of mathematics largely for his role as \
inspirer and director of others, and perhaps to him is due the sharp \
distinction in ancient Greece between arithmetic (in the sense of the theory \
of numbers) and logistic (the technique of computation). Plato regarded \
logistic as appropriate for the businessman and for the man of war, who \
\\\"must learn the art of numbers or he will not know how to array his \
troops.\\\" The philosopher, on the other hand, must be an arithmetician \
\\\"because he has to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true \
being.\\\"'</ref> Plato's resurgence further inspired some of the greatest \
advances in logic since Aristotle, primarily through [[Gottlob Frege]] and \
his followers [[Kurt G\[ODoubleDot]del]], [[Alonzo Church]], and [[Alfred \
Tarski]]. [[Albert Einstein]] suggested that the scientist who takes \
philosophy seriously would have to avoid systematization and take on many \
different roles, and possibly appear as a Platonist or Pythagorean, in that \
such a one would have \\\"the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an \
indispensable and effective tool of his \
research.\\\"{{sfn|Einstein|1949|pp=683\[Dash]684}}\\n\\nMany recent \
philosophers have diverged from what some would describe as the \
[[ontology|ontological]] models and [[moral]] ideals characteristic of \
traditional Platonism. A number of these postmodern philosophers have thus \
appeared to disparage Platonism from more or less informed perspectives. \
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] notoriously attacked Plato's \\\"idea of the good \
itself\\\" along with many fundamentals of Christian morality, which he \
interpreted as \\\"Platonism for the masses\\\" in one of his most important \
works, ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]] ''(1886). [[Martin Heidegger]] argued \
against Plato's alleged obfuscation of ''[[Being]] ''in his incomplete tome, \
''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927), and the philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]] \
argued in ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) that Plato's \
alleged proposal for a [[utopia]]n political regime in the ''[[The Republic \
(Plato)|Republic]]'' was prototypically [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]]. The \
political philosopher and professor [[Leo Strauss]] is considered by some as \
the prime thinker involved in the recovery of Platonic thought in its more \
political, and less metaphysical, form. Strauss' political approach was in \
part inspired by the appropriation of Plato and Aristotle by medieval \
[[Jewish philosophy|Jewish]] and [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic]] [[political \
philosophy|political philosophers]], especially [[Maimonides]] and \
[[Al-Farabi]], as opposed to the Christian metaphysical tradition that \
developed from [[Neoplatonism]]. Deeply influenced by Nietzsche and \
Heidegger, Strauss nonetheless rejects their condemnation of Plato and looks \
to the dialogues for a solution to what all three latter day thinkers \
acknowledge as 'the crisis of the West.'\\n\\n===Textual sources and \
history===\\n[[File:Clarke Plato page 1 recto.jpg|thumb|First page of the \
''Euthyphro'', from the Clarke Plato (Codex Oxoniensis Clarkianus 39), 895 \
AD. The text is [[Greek minuscule]].]]\\n{{See also|List of manuscripts of \

survive.{{sfn|Brumbaugh|Wells|1989}} The texts of Plato as received today \
apparently represent the complete written philosophical work of Plato and are \
generally good by the standards of [[textual \
criticism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Irwin|2011|pp=64 & 74}}. See also \
{{harvnb|Slings|1987|p=34}}: \\\"... primary MSS. together offer a text of \
tolerably good quality\\\" (this is without the further corrections of other \
sources).</ref> No modern edition of Plato in the original Greek represents a \
single source, but rather it is reconstructed from multiple sources which are \
compared with each other. These sources are medieval manuscripts written on \
vellum (mainly from 9th to 13th century AD Byzantium), papyri (mainly from \
late antiquity in Egypt), and from the independent ''testimonia'' of other \
authors who quote various segments of the works (which come from a variety of \
sources). The text as presented is usually not much different from what \
appears in the Byzantine manuscripts, and papyri and testimonia just confirm \
the manuscript tradition. In some editions however the readings in the papyri \
or testimonia are favoured in some places by the editing critic of the text. \
Reviewing editions of papyri for the ''Republic'' in 1987, Slings suggests \
that the use of papyri is hampered due to some poor editing \
practices.{{sfn|Slings|1987|p=31}}\\n\\nIn the first century AD, [[Thrasyllus \
of Mendes]] had compiled and published the works of Plato in the original \
Greek, both genuine and spurious. While it has not survived to the present \
day, all the extant medieval Greek manuscripts are based on his \
edition.{{sfn|Cooper|1997|pp=viii\[Dash]xii}}\\n\\nThe oldest surviving \
complete manuscript for many of the dialogues is the Clarke Plato (Codex \
Oxoniensis Clarkianus 39, or Codex Boleianus MS E.D. Clarke 39), which was \
written in Constantinople in 895 and acquired by [[Oxford University]] in \
1809.<ref>{{cite \

[[Peloponnesian war]], and he lived 82 years.<ref name=\\\"Suda\\\">{{cite \

[[Renaissance]] [[Platonist]]s celebrated Plato's birth on November \

that Plato was born when Diotimos was [[archon#Ancient Greece|archon \

BC.{{sfn|Wilamowitz-Moellendorff|2005|p=46}} Greek philologist Ioannis \
Kalitsounakis believes that the philosopher was born on May 26 or 27, 427 BC, \
while [[Jonathan Barnes]] regards 428 BC as year of Plato's birth.<ref \

Volume V (in Greek)|year=1952}}</ref> For her part, [[Debra Nails]] asserts \
that the philosopher was born in 424/423 BC.{{sfn|Nails|2006|p=1}} According \
to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] Plato died at the age of 81 on the same day \
he was born.<ref>[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], Epistulae, VI, 58, 31: \
''natali suo decessit et annum umum atque octogensimum''.</ref>\\n\\n'''c.''' \
{{Note label|C|c|none}} Diogenes Laertius mentions that Plato \\\"was born, \
according to some writers, in Aegina in the house of Phidiades the son of \
Thales\\\". Diogenes mentions as one of his sources the ''Universal History'' \
of [[Favorinus]]. According to Favorinus, Ariston, Plato's family, and his \
family were sent by Athens to settle as [[cleruchy|cleruch]]s (colonists \
retaining their Athenian citizenship), on the island of Aegina, from which \
they were expelled by the Spartans after Plato's birth there.<ref \
name=\\\"LaIII\\\">Diogenes Laertius, ''Life of Plato'', III</ref> Nails \
points out, however, that there is no record of any Spartan expulsion of \
Athenians from Aegina between 431\[Dash]411 BC.{{sfn|Nails|2002|p=54}} On the \
other hand, at the [[Peace of Nicias]], Aegina was silently left under \
Athens' control, and it was not until the summer of 411 that the Spartans \
overran the island.<ref name=\\\"Th5.18.8.92\\\">Thucydides, [[s:History of \
the Peloponnesian War/Book 5#5:18|5.18]] <br />\[Bullet] Thucydides, \
[[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 8#8:92|8.92]]</ref> Therefore, \
Nails concludes that \\\"perhaps Ariston was a cleruch, perhaps he went to \
Aegina in 431, and perhaps Plato was born on Aegina, but none of this enables \
a precise dating of Ariston's death (or Plato's \
birth).{{sfn|Nails|2002|p=54}} Aegina is regarded as Plato's place of birth \
by Suda as well.<ref name=\\\"Suda\\\" />\\n\\n'''d.''' {{Note \
label|D|d|none}} Some Wikipedia editors use the term ''allegory'' instead of \
myth. This is in accordance with the practice in the specialized literature, \
in which it is common to find that the terms allegory and myth are used as \
synonyms. Nevertheless, there is a trend among modern scholars to use the \
term ''myth'' and avoid the term allegory, as it is considered more \
appropriate to modern interpretation of Plato's writings. One of the first to \
initiate this trend was the Oxford University professor [[John Alexander \
Stewart (philosopher)|John Alexander Stewart]], in his work ''The Myths of \
Plato''.\\n{{Refend}}\\n\\n==Citations==\\n{{Reflist|30em}}\\n\\n==References=\

possibly the son of Euphronius of the [[Athenian]] [[deme]] [[Sunium]], was a \
[[Greece|Greek]] mathematician. His principal contributions were on \
[[irrational number|irrational]] lengths, which was included in ''Book X'' of \
[[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', and proving that there are \
precisely five [[Platonic solid|regular convex polyhedra]].<ref>''Greek \
Geometry from Thales to Euclid'' by [[George Johnston Allman]] (Hodges, \
Figgis, & Company, 1889, p. 206).</ref> A friend of [[Socrates]] and \

(dialogue)|eponymous Socratic dialogue]].<ref>[[Plato]], \
''[http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/theatu.html \
Theaetetus]''.</ref>\\n\\nTheaetetus, like [[Plato]], was a student of the \
Greek mathematician [[Theodorus of Cyrene]]. Cyrene was a prosperous Greek \
colony on the coast of North Africa, in what is now Libya, on the eastern end \
of the [[Gulf of Sidra]]. Theodorus had explored the theory of \
incommensurable quantities, and Theaetetus continued those studies with great \
enthusiasm; specifically, he classified various forms of irrational numbers \
according to the way they are expressed as square roots. This theory is \
presented in great detail in Book X of Euclid's ''Elements''.\\n\\nTheaetetus \
was one of the few Greek mathematicians who was actually a native of Athens. \
Most Greek mathematicians of antiquity came from the numerous Greek cities \
scattered around the [[Ionia]]n coast, the [[Black Sea]] and the whole \
[[Mediterranean]] basin.\\n\\nHe evidently resembled [[Socrates]] in the \
snubness of his nose and bulging of his eyes. This and most of what we know \
of him comes from [[Plato]], who named a dialogue after him, the \
''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''. He apparently died from wounds and \
[[dysentery]] on his way home after fighting in an Athenian battle at \
[[Corinth]], now presumed to have occurred in 369 BC; some scholars argue \
alternately for 391 BC as his date of death, the date of an earlier battle at \
Corinth.<ref>[[Debra Nails]], ''The People of Plato''. Indianapolis: Hackett \
Publishing, 2002; pp. 275\[Dash]278</ref>\\n\\nThe crater [[Theaetetus \

loved to watch stars at night. Eudoxus first travelled to \
[[Taranto|Tarentum]] to study with [[Archytas]], from whom he learned \
[[mathematics]]. While in [[Italy]], Eudoxus visited [[Sicily]], where he \
studied medicine with [[Philistion of Locri|Philiston]].\\n\\nAround \
387&nbsp;BC, at the age of 23, he traveled with the physician [[Theomedon]]\
\[LongDash]who (according to [[Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius]]) some believed \
was his lover<ref>Diogenes Laertius; VIII.87</ref>\[LongDash]to [[Athens]] to \
study with the followers of [[Socrates]]. He eventually attended lectures of \
[[Plato]] and other philosophers for several months, but due to a \
disagreement they had a falling-out. Eudoxus was quite poor and could only \
afford an apartment at the [[Piraeus]]. To attend Plato's lectures, he walked \
the {{convert|7|mi|km}} in each direction each day. Due to his poverty, his \
friends raised funds sufficient to send him to [[Heliopolis (Ancient \
Egypt)|Heliopolis]], [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], to pursue his study of astronomy \
and mathematics. He lived there for 16 months. From Egypt, he then traveled \
north to [[Cyzicus]], located on the south shore of the Sea of Marmara, the \
[[Propontis]]. He traveled south to the court of [[Mausolus]]. During his \
travels he gathered many students of his own.\\n\\nAround 368 BC, Eudoxus \
returned to Athens with his students. According to some sources, around 367 \
he assumed headship of the Academy during Plato's period in Syracuse, and \
taught [[Aristotle]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} He eventually \
returned to his native Cnidus, where he served in the city assembly. While in \
Cnidus, he built an observatory and continued writing and lecturing on \
[[theology]], astronomy, and [[meteorology]]. He had one son, Aristagoras, \
and three daughters, Actis, Philtis, and Delphis.\\n\\nIn mathematical \
astronomy, his fame is due to the introduction of the [[concentric \
spheres|astronomical globe]], and his early contributions to understanding \
the movement of the [[planet]]s.\\n\\nHis work on [[Proportion \
(mathematics)|proportion]]s shows insight into [[number]]s; it allows \
rigorous treatment of continuous quantities and not just [[Integer|whole \
numbers]] or even [[rational number]]s. When it was revived by [[Niccol\
\[OGrave] Fontana Tartaglia|Tartaglia]] and others in the 16th century, it \
became the basis for quantitative work in science for a century, until it was \
replaced by [[Richard Dedekind]].\\n\\n[[Impact crater|Craters]] on [[List of \
craters on Mars#E|Mars]] and the [[Eudoxus (lunar crater)|Moon]] are named in \
his honor. An [[algebraic curve]] (the [[Kampyle of Eudoxus]]) is also named \
after him.\\n\\n==Mathematics<!--Linked from 'Galileo Galilei'-->==\\nEudoxus \
is considered by some to be the greatest of [[Classical Greece|classical \

to [[Archimedes]].<ref name=calinger>{{Cite book |last=Calinger |first=Ronald \

He rigorously developed [[Antiphon (person)|Antiphon]]'s [[method of \
exhaustion]],  a precursor to the [[integral calculus]] which was also used \
in a masterly way by Archimedes in the following century.  In applying the \
method, Eudoxus proved such mathematical statements as: areas of circles are \
to one another as the squares of their radii, volumes of spheres are to one \
another as the cubes of their radii, the volume of a pyramid is one-third the \
volume of a [[Prism (geometry)|prism]] with the same base and altitude, and \
the volume of a cone is one-third that of the corresponding cylinder.<ref \
name=\\\"Kline\\\">Morris Kline, ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to \
Modern Times'' Oxford University Press, 1972 pp. \
48\[Dash]50</ref>\\n\\nEudoxus introduced the idea of non-quantified \
mathematical [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] to describe and work with \
continuous geometrical entities such as lines, angles, areas and volumes, \
thereby avoiding the use of [[irrational number]]s. In doing so, he reversed \
a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] emphasis on number and arithmetic, focusing \
instead on geometrical concepts as the basis of rigorous mathematics. Some \
Pythagoreans, such as Eudoxus' teacher [[Archytas]], had believed that only \
arithmetic could provide a basis for proofs. Induced by the need to \
understand and operate with [[Commensurability \
(mathematics)|incommensurable]] quantities, Eudoxus established what may have \
been the first deductive organization of mathematics on the basis of explicit \
[[axiom]]s. The change in focus by Eudoxus stimulated a divide in mathematics \
which lasted two thousand years. In combination with a Greek intellectual \
attitude unconcerned with practical problems, there followed a significant \
retreat from the development of techniques in arithmetic and algebra.<ref \
name=\\\"Kline\\\" />\\n\\nThe Pythagoreans had discovered that the diagonal \
of a square does not have a common unit of measurement with the sides of the \
square; this is the famous discovery that the [[square root of 2]] cannot be \
expressed as the ratio of two integers. This discovery had heralded the \
existence of incommensurable quantities beyond the integers and rational \
fractions, but at the same time it threw into question the idea of \
measurement and calculations in geometry as a whole. For example, Euclid \
provides an elaborate proof of the Pythagorean theorem (''Elements'' I.47), \
by using addition of areas and only much later (''Elements'' VI.31) a simpler \
proof from similar triangles, which relies on ratios of line \
segments.\\n\\nAncient Greek mathematicians calculated not with quantities \
and equations as we do today, but instead they used proportionalities to \
express the relationship between quantities. Thus the ratio of two similar \
quantities was not just a numerical value, as we think of it today; the ratio \
of two similar quantities was a primitive relationship between \
them.\\n\\nEudoxus was able to restore confidence in the use of \
proportionalities by providing an astounding definition for the meaning of \
the equality between two ratios. This definition of proportion forms the \
subject of Euclid's Book V.\\n\\nIn Definition 5 of Euclid's Book V we \
read:\\n\\n{{Quote|Magnitudes are said to be in the same ratio, the first to \
the second and the third to the fourth when, if any equimultiples whatever be \
taken of the first and third, and any equimultiples whatever of the second \
and fourth, the former equimultiples alike exceed, are alike equal to, or \
alike fall short of, the latter equimultiples respectively taken in \
corresponding order.}}\\n\\nBy using modern-day notation, this is clarified \
as follows. If we take four quantities: ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', and ''d'', then \
the first and second have a ratio <math>a/b</math>; similarly the third and \
fourth have a ratio <math>c/d</math>.\\n\\nNow to say that <math>a/b = \
c/d</math> we do the following:\\nFor any two arbitrary integers, ''m'' and \
''n'', form the equimultiples\\n''m''\[CenterDot]''a'' and \
''m''\[CenterDot]''c'' of the first and third; likewise form the \
equimultiples ''n''\[CenterDot]''b'' and ''n''\[CenterDot]''d'' of the second \
and fourth.\\n\\nIf it happens that ''m''\[CenterDot]''a'' > \
''n''\[CenterDot]''b'', then we must also have ''m''\[CenterDot]''c'' > ''n''\
\[CenterDot]''d''.\\nIf it happens that ''m''\[CenterDot]''a'' = ''n''\
\[CenterDot]''b'', then we must also have ''m''\[CenterDot]''c'' = ''n''\
\[CenterDot]''d''. Finally, if it happens that ''m''\[CenterDot]''a'' < ''n''\
\[CenterDot]''b'', then we must also have ''m''\[CenterDot]''c'' < ''n''\
\[CenterDot]''d''.\\n\\nNotice that the definition depends on comparing the \
similar quantities ''m''\[CenterDot]''a'' and ''n''\[CenterDot]''b'', and the \
similar quantities ''m''\[CenterDot]''c'' and ''n''\[CenterDot]''d'', and \
does not depend on the existence of a common unit of measuring these \
quantities.\\n\\nThe complexity of the definition reflects the deep \
conceptual and methodological innovation involved. It brings to mind the \
famous [[parallel postulate|fifth postulate of Euclid]] concerning parallels, \
which is more extensive and complicated in its wording than the other \
postulates.\\n\\nThe Eudoxian definition of proportionality uses the \
quantifier, \\\"for every ...\\\" to harness the infinite and the \
infinitesimal, just as do the modern [[epsilon-delta definition]]s of limit \
and continuity.\\n\\nAdditionally, the [[Archimedean property]] stated as \
definition 4 of Euclid's book V is originally due not to Archimedes but to \
Eudoxus.<ref name=\\\"Knopp1951\\\">{{Cite book |last=Knopp |first=Konrad \

Greece]], astronomy was a branch of mathematics; astronomers sought to create \
geometrical models that could imitate the appearances of celestial motions. \
Identifying the astronomical work of Eudoxus as a separate category is \
therefore a modern convenience. Some of Eudoxus' astronomical texts whose \
names have survived include:\\n\\n* ''Disappearances of the Sun'', possibly \
on eclipses\\n* ''Oktaeteris'' (\:1f48\[Kappa]\[Tau]\[Alpha]\[CurlyEpsilon]\
\[Tau]\[Eta]\[Rho]\:03af\[FinalSigma]), on an eight-year lunisolar cycle of \
the calendar\\n* ''Phaenomena'' (\[CapitalPhi]\[Alpha]\[Iota]\[Nu]\:03cc\[Mu]\
\[CurlyEpsilon]\[Nu]\[Alpha]) and ''Entropon'' (\:1f1c\[Nu]\[Tau]\[Rho]\
\[Omicron]\[Pi]\[Omicron]\[Nu]), on [[spherical astronomy]], probably based \
on observations made by Eudoxus in Egypt and Cnidus\\n* ''On Speeds'', on \
planetary motions\\n\\nWe are fairly well informed about the contents of \
''Phaenomena'', for Eudoxus' prose text was the basis for a poem of the same \
name by [[Aratus]]. [[Hipparchus]] quoted from the text of Eudoxus in his \
commentary on Aratus.\\n\\n===Eudoxan planetary models===\\nA general idea of \
the content of ''On Speeds'' can be gleaned from [[Aristotle]]'s \
''Metaphysics'' XII, 8, and a commentary by [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] (6th \
century AD) on ''De caelo'', another work by Aristotle. According to a story \
reported by Simplicius, Plato posed a question for Greek astronomers: \\\"By \
the assumption of what uniform and orderly motions can the apparent motions \
of the planets be accounted for?\\\" (quoted in Lloyd 1970, p.&nbsp;84). \
Plato proposed that the seemingly chaotic wandering motions of the planets \
could be explained by combinations of uniform circular motions centered on a \
spherical Earth, apparently a novel idea in the 4th century BC.\\n\\nIn most \
modern reconstructions of the Eudoxan model, the Moon is assigned three \
spheres:\\n\\n* The outermost rotates westward once in 24 hours, explaining \
rising and setting.\\n* The second rotates eastward once in a month, \
explaining the monthly motion of the Moon through the [[zodiac]].\\n* The \
third also completes its revolution in a month, but its axis is tilted at a \
slightly different angle, explaining motion in latitude (deviation from the \
[[ecliptic]]), and the motion of the [[lunar node]]s.\\n\\nThe Sun is also \
assigned three spheres. The second completes its motion in a year instead of \
a month. The inclusion of a third sphere implies that Eudoxus mistakenly \
believed that the Sun had motion in latitude.\\n\\nThe five visible planets \
([[Venus]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], and \
[[Saturn]]) are assigned four spheres each:\\n\\n* The outermost explains the \
daily motion.\\n* The second explains the planet's motion through the zodiac.\
\\n* The third and fourth together explain [[apparent retrograde \
motion|retrogradation]], when a planet appears to slow down, then briefly \
reverse its motion through the zodiac. By inclining the axes of the two \
spheres with respect to each other, and rotating them in opposite directions \
but with equal periods, Eudoxus could make a point on the inner sphere trace \
out a figure-eight shape, or [[hippopede]].\\n\\n===Importance of Eudoxan \
system===\\n[[Callippus]], a Greek astronomer of the 4th century, added seven \
spheres to Eudoxus' original 27 (in addition to the planetary spheres, \
Eudoxus included a sphere for the fixed stars). Aristotle described both \
systems, but insisted on adding \\\"unrolling\\\" spheres between each set of \
spheres to cancel the motions of the outer set. Aristotle was concerned about \
the physical nature of the system; without unrollers, the outer motions would \
be transferred to the inner planets.\\n\\nA major flaw in the Eudoxan system \
is its inability to explain changes in the brightness of planets as seen from \
Earth. Because the spheres are concentric, planets will always remain at the \
same distance from Earth. This problem was pointed out in Antiquity by \
[[Autolycus of Pitane]]. Astronomers responded by introducing the [[deferent \
and epicycle]], which caused a planet to vary its distance. However, Eudoxus' \
importance to [[Greek astronomy]] is considerable, as he was the first to \
attempt a mathematical explanation of the \
planets.\\n\\n==Ethics==\\n[[Aristotle]], in the ''[[Nicomachean \
Ethics]]'',<ref>Largely in Book Ten.</ref> attributes to Eudoxus an argument \
in favor of [[hedonism]]\[LongDash]that is, that pleasure is the ultimate \
good that activity strives for.  According to Aristotle, Eudoxus put forward \
the following arguments for this position:\\n# All things, rational and \
irrational, aim at pleasure; things aim at what they believe to be good; a \
good indication of what the chief good is would be the thing that most things \
aim at.\\n# Similarly, pleasure's opposite\[LongDash]pain\[LongDash]is \
universally avoided, which provides additional support for the idea that \
pleasure is universally considered good.\\n# People don't seek pleasure as a \
means to something else, but as an end in its own right.\\n# Any other good \
that you can think of would be better if pleasure were added to it, and it is \
only by good that good can be increased.\\n# Of all of the things that are \
good, happiness is peculiar for not being praised, which may show that it is \
the crowning good.<ref>This particular argument is referenced in Book \
One.</ref>\\n\\n==See also==\\n* [[Incommensurable magnitudes]]\\n* \

celebrated discovery of the same in 1610 (all four of the brightest moons are \
technically visible to the unaided eye, but in practice are normally hidden \
by the glare of Jupiter). By occluding Jupiter itself behind a high tree limb \
perpendicular to the satellites' [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] \
to prevent the planet's glare from obscuring them, one or more of the \
[[Galilean moons]] might be spotted in favorable conditions. However, Gan De \
reported the color of the companion as reddish, which is puzzling since the \
moons are too faint for their color to be perceived with the naked eye.<ref \

him.\\n\\n[[Iamblichus]] states that Thymaridas called [[prime number]]s \
\\\"rectilinear\\\" since they can only be represented on a one-dimensional \
line. Non-prime numbers, on the other hand, can be represented on a \
two-dimensional plane as a rectangle with sides that, when multiplied, \
produce the non-prime number in question. He further called the number \
[[one]] a \\\"limiting quantity\\\".\\n\\nIamblichus in his comments to \

[[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]], [[Greek \
Mathematics|mathematician]], and leader ([[scholarch]]) of the [[Platonic \
Academy]] from 339/8 to 314/3 BC. His teachings followed those of [[Plato]], \
which he attempted to define more closely, often with mathematical elements. \
He distinguished three forms of being: the sensible, the intelligible, and a \
third compounded of the two, to which correspond respectively, [[sense]], \
[[intellect]] and [[opinion]]. He considered unity and duality to be [[gods]] \
which rule the [[universe]], and the soul a self-moving [[number]]. [[God]] \
pervades all things, and there are [[Daemon (mythology)|daemonical]] powers, \
intermediate between the [[Divinity|divine]] and the [[Human|mortal]], which \
consist in conditions of the soul. He held that [[mathematical]] objects and \
the [[Theory of Forms|Platonic Ideas]] are identical, unlike Plato who \
distinguished them. In [[ethics]], he taught that [[virtue]] produces \
[[happiness]], but external goods can minister to it and enable it to effect \
its purpose.\\n\\n==Life==\\nXenocrates was a native of \
[[Chalcedon]].<ref>Cicero, ''Academica'', i. 4; Athenaeus, xii.; Stobaeus, \

82. Moving to [[Athens]] in early youth, he became the pupil of [[Aeschines \
Socraticus]],<ref>Athenaeus, ix</ref> but subsequently joined himself to \
[[Plato]],{{sfn|La\[EDoubleDot]rtius|1925|loc=\[Section] 6}} whom he \
accompanied to [[Sicily]] in 361.{{sfn|La\[EDoubleDot]rtius|1925|loc=\

[[Aristotle]] to [[Hermias of Atarneus]].<ref>Strabo, xii.</ref> In 339/8 BC, \
Xenocrates succeeded [[Speusippus]] in the presidency of the school,{{sfn|La\

competitors [[Menedemus of Pyrrha]] and [[Heraclides Ponticus]] by a few \

[[Antipater]].{{sfn|La\[EDoubleDot]rtius|1925|loc=\[Section]  8, \
9}}\\n\\nXenocrates resented the [[Macedon]]ian influence then dominant at \
Athens. Soon after the death of [[Demosthenes]] (c. 322 BC), he declined the \
citizenship offered to him at the instance of [[Phocion]]{{sfn|Jackson|1911}} \
as a reward for his services in negotiating peace with [[Antipater]] after \
Athens' unsuccessful rebellion.  The settlement was reached \\\"at the price \
of a constitutional change: thousands of poor Athenians were disenfranchised,\
\\\" and Xenocrates said \\\"that he did not want to become a citizen within \
a constitution he had struggled to \
prevent\\\".<ref>{{harvnb|Habicht|1988|p=14}} citing \

succeeded as [[scholarch]] by [[Polemon (scholarch)|Polemon]], whom he had \
reclaimed from a life of profligacy. Besides Polemon, the statesman Phocion, \
[[Chaeron of Pellene|Chaeron]] (tyrant of [[Pellene]]), the academic \

he is accounted the typical representative of the Old Academy. In his \
writings, which were numerous, he seems to have covered nearly the whole of \
the Academic program; but [[metaphysics]] and [[ethics]] were the subjects \
which principally engaged his thoughts. He is said to have made more explicit \
the division of philosophy into the three parts of [[Physics]], [[Dialectic]] \

definite division between the three departments of philosophy, than \
[[Speusippus]],<ref>Sextus Empiricus, ''adv. Math.'' vii. 16</ref> but at the \
same time abandoned Plato's heuristic method of conducting through doubts \
(''aporiai''), and adopted instead a mode of bringing forward his doctrines \
in which they were developed dogmatically.<ref>Sextus Empiricus, ''Hypotyp.'' \
i. 2; comp. Cicero, ''Academica'', i. 4; \
{{harvnb|La\[EDoubleDot]rtius|1925|loc=\[Section] 11, \
16}}</ref>\\n\\nXenocrates recognized three grades of cognition, each \
appropriated to a region of its own: knowledge, sensation, and opinion. He \
referred knowledge (''episteme'') to that essence which is the object of pure \
thought, and is not included in the phenomenal world; sensation \
(''aisthesis'') to that which passes into the world of phenomena; opinion \
(''doxa'') to that essence which is at once the object of sensuous \
perception, and, mathematically, of pure reason - the essence of [[heaven]] \
or the [[star]]s; so that he conceived of ''doxa'' in a higher sense, and \
endeavoured, more definitely than Plato, to exhibit mathematics as mediating \
between knowledge and sensuous perception.<ref>Sextus Empiricus, ''adv. \
Math.'' vii. 147, etc.</ref> All three modes of apprehension partake of \
truth; but in what manner scientific perception (''epistemonike aisthesis'') \
did so, we unfortunately do not learn. Even here Xenocrates's preference for \
symbolic modes of sensualising or denoting appears: he connected the above \
three stages of knowledge with the three [[Moirai|Fates]]: [[Atropos]], \
[[Clotho]], and [[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]]. We know nothing further \
about the mode in which Xenocrates carried out his [[dialectic]], as it is \
probable that what was peculiar to [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] logic did \
not remain unnoticed in it, for it can hardly be doubted that the division of \
the existent into the absolutely existent, and the relatively \
existent,<ref>Simplicius, ''in Arist. Categ.'' iii. f. 6, b</ref> attributed \
to Xenocrates, was opposed to the Aristotelian table of [[Categories \
(Aristotle)|categories]].\\n\\n===Metaphysics===\\nWe know from \
[[Plutarch]]<ref>Plutarch, ''de Animae procreat. e Tim.''</ref> that \
Xenocrates, if he did not explain the Platonic construction of the world-soul \
as [[Crantor]] after him did, nevertheless drew heavily on the ''[[Timaeus \
(dialogue)|Timaeus]]''; and further<ref>Aristotle, ''de Caelo'', i. 10, 32, \
''Metaph.'' xiv. 4</ref> that he was at the head of those who, regarding the \
universe as unoriginated and imperishable, looked upon the chronological \
succession in the Platonic theory as a form in which to denote the relations \
of conceptual succession. Plutarch unfortunately, does not give us any \
further details, and contented himself with describing the well-known \
assumption of Xenocrates, that the soul is a self-moving \
number.<ref>Plutarch, ''de Animae procreat. e Tim.'', comp. Aristotle, ''de \
Anima'', i. 2, 4, ''Anal. Post.'' ii. 4, ''ib.'' Interp.</ref> Probably we \
should connect with this the statement that Xenocrates called unity and \
duality (''monas'' and ''duas'') deities, and characterised the former as the \
first male existence, ruling in heaven, as father and [[Zeus]], as uneven \
number and spirit; the latter as female, as the mother of the gods, and as \
the soul of the universe which reigns over the mutable world under \
heaven,<ref>Stobaeus, Ecl. Phys. i. 62</ref> or, as others have it, that he \
named the Zeus who ever remains like himself, governing in the sphere of the \
immutable, the highest; the one who rules over the mutable, sublunary world, \
the last, or outermost.<ref>Plutarch, ''Plat. Quaest.'' ix. 1; Clement of \
Alexandria, ''Stromata'', v. 604</ref>\\n\\nIf, like other Platonists, he \
designated the material principle as undefined duality, the world-soul was \
probably described by him as the first defined duality, the conditioning or \
defining principle of every separate definitude in the sphere of the material \
and changeable, but not extending beyond it. He appears to have called it in \
the highest sense the individual soul, in a derivative sense a self-moving \
number, that is, the first number endowed with motion. To this world-soul \
Zeus, or the world-spirit, has entrusted - in what degree and in what extent, \
we do not learn - dominion over that which is liable to motion and change. \
The divine power of the world-soul is then again represented, in the \
different spheres of the universe, as infusing soul into the planets, Sun and \
Moon, - in a purer form, in the shape of [[Twelve Olympians|Olympic gods]]. \
As a sublunary [[Daemon (mythology)|daemonical]] power (as [[Hera]], \
[[Poseidon]], [[Demeter]]), it dwells in the elements, and these daemonical \
natures, midway between gods and men, are related to them as the \
[[isosceles]] triangle is to the [[equilateral]] and the [[Triangle#Types of \
triangle|scalene]].<ref>Stobaeus, Ecl. Phys. i. 62; Plutarch, ''de Orac. \
defect.''; Cicero, ''de Natura Deorum'', i. 13</ref> The divine world-soul \
which reigns over the whole domain of sublunary changes he appears to have \
designated as the last Zeus, the last divine activity.\\n\\nIt is not until \
we get to the sphere of the separate daemonical powers of [[nature]] that the \
opposition between [[good and evil]] begins,<ref>Stobaeus, ''Ecl. \
Phys.''</ref> and the daemonical power is appeased by means of a stubbornness \
which it finds there congenial to it; the good daemonical power makes happy \
those in whom it takes up its abode, the bad ruins them; for [[eudaimonia]] \
is the indwelling of a good daemon, the opposite the indwelling of a bad \
one.<ref>Plutarch, ''de Isid. et Os.'', ''de Orac. defect.''; Aristotle, \
''Topica'', ii. 2; Stobaeus, ''Serm'', civ. 24</ref>\\n\\nHow Xenocrates \
tried to establish and connect scientifically these assumptions, which appear \
to be taken chiefly from his books on the nature of the gods,<ref>Cicero, \
''de Natura Deorum'', i. 13</ref> we do not learn, and can only discover the \
one fundamental idea at the basis of them, that all grades of existence are \
penetrated by divine power, and that this grows less and less energetic in \
proportion as it descends to the perishable and individual. Hence he also \
appears to have maintained that as far as consciousness extends, so far also \
extends an intuition of that all-ruling divine power, of which he represented \
even irrational animals as partaking.<ref>Clement of Alexandria, \
''Stromata'', v. 590</ref> But neither the thick nor the thin, to the \
different combinations of which he appears to have tried to refer the various \
grades of material existence, were regarded by him as in themselves partaking \
of soul;<ref>Plutarch, ''de Fac. in orbe lunae''</ref> doubtless because he \
referred them immediately to the divine activity, and was far from attempting \
to reconcile the duality of the ''principia'', or to resolve them into an \
original unity. Hence too he was for proving the incorporeality of the soul \
by the fact that it is not nourished as the body is.<ref>Nemesius, ''De \
Natura Hominis''</ref>\\n\\nIt is probable, that, after the example of \
[[Plato]], he designated the divine ''principium'' as alone indivisible, and \
remaining like itself; the material, as the divisible, partaking of \
multiformity, and different, and that from the union of the two, or from the \
limitation of the unlimited by the absolute unity, he deduced number, and for \
that reason called the soul of the universe, like that of individual beings, \
a self-moving number, which, by virtue of its twofold root in the same and \
the different, shares equally in permanence and motion, and attains to \
consciousness by means of the reconciliation of this \
opposition.\\n\\n[[Aristotle]], in his ''[[Metaphysics \
(Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'',<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaph.'' vii.2.1028</ref> \
recognized amongst contemporary Platonists three principal views concerning \
the ''ideal'' numbers, and their relation to the ideas and to \
''mathematical'' [[number]]s:\\n\\n#those who, like Plato, distinguished \
''ideal'' and ''mathematical'' numbers;\\n#those who, like Xenocrates, \
identified ''ideal'' numbers with ''mathematical'' numbers\\n#those who, like \
Speusippus, postulated ''mathematical'' numbers only\\n\\nAristotle has much \
to say against the Xenocratean interpretation of the theory, and in \
particular points out that, if the ideal numbers are made up of arithmetical \
units, they not only cease to be principles, but also become subject to \
arithmetical operations.\\n\\nIn the derivation of things according to the \
series of the numbers he seems to have gone further than any of his \
predecessors.<ref>Theophrastus, ''Met.'' c. 3</ref> He approximated to the \
[[Pythagoreans]] in this, that (as is clear from his explanation of the soul) \
he regarded number as the conditioning principle of consciousness, and \
consequently of knowledge also; he thought it necessary, however, to supply \
what was wanting in the Pythagorean assumption by the more accurate \
definition, borrowed from Plato, that it is only insofar as number reconciles \
the opposition between the same and the different, and has raised itself to \
self-motion, that it is soul. We find a similar attempt at the \
supplementation of the Platonic doctrine in Xenocrates's assumption of \
indivisible lines.<ref>Aristotle, ''de Lin. insec. Phys. Ausc.'' vi. 2; comp. \
Simplicius, ''in Arist. Phys.'' f. 30</ref> In them he thought he had \
discovered what, according to Plato,<ref>Plato ''Timaeus''</ref> God alone \
knows, and he among men who is loved by him, namely, the elements or \
principia of the Platonic triangles. He seems to have described them as \
first, original lines, and in a similar sense to have spoken of original \
plain figures and bodies,<ref>Simplicius, ''in Arist. de Caelo''</ref> \
convinced that the ''principia'' of the existent should be sought not in the \
material, not in the divisible which attains to the condition of a \
phenomenon, but merely in the ideal definitude of form. He may very well, in \
accordance with this, have regarded the point as a merely subjectively \
admissible presupposition, and a passage of Aristotle respecting this \
assumption<ref>Aristotle, ''de Anima'', i. 4, extr.</ref> should perhaps be \
referred to him.\\n\\n===Ethics===\\nThe information on his Ethics is scanty. \
He tried to supplement the Platonic doctrine at various points, and at the \
same time to give it a more direct applicability to life. He distinguished \
from the good and the bad something which is neither good nor bad.<ref>Sextus \
Empiricus, ''adv. Math.'' xi. 4</ref> Following the ideas of his Academic \
predecessors, he viewed the good as that which should be striven after for \
itself, that is, which has value in itself, while the bad is the opposite of \
this.<ref>Cicero, ''de Legibus'', i. 13</ref> Consequently, that which is \
neither good nor bad is what in itself is neither to be striven after nor to \
be avoided, but derives value or the opposite according as it serves as means \
for what is good or bad, or rather, is used by us for that \
purpose.\\n[[Image:Xenocrates Nuremberg \
Chronicle.jpg|left|180px|thumb|Xenocrates, depicted as a medieval scholar in \
the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]\\n\\nWhile, however, Xenocrates (and with \
him Speusippus and the other philosophers of the older Academy)<ref>Cicero, \
''de Finibus'', iv. 18, etc.</ref> would not accept that these intermediate \
things, such as [[health]], [[beauty]], [[Celebrity|fame]], good \
[[Destiny|fortune]], etc. were valuable in themselves, he did not accept that \
they were absolutely worthless or indifferent.<ref>Cicero, ''de Legibus'', i. \
21</ref> According, therefore, as what belongs to the intermediate region is \
adapted to bring about or to hinder the good, Xenocrates appears to have \
designated it as good or evil, probably with the proviso, that by misuse what \
is good might become evil, and vice versa, that by virtue, what is evil might \
become good.<ref>Cicero, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', v. 10, \
18.</ref>\\n\\nStill he maintained that virtue alone is valuable in itself, \
and that the value of every thing else is conditional.<ref>Cicero, \
''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', v. 10, 18., comp. ''Academica'', i. 6</ref> \
According to this, happiness should coincide with the consciousness of \
virtue,<ref>Aristotle, ''Topica'', ii. 6, vii. 1, ib. Alex.</ref> though its \
reference to the relations of human life requires the additional condition, \
that it is only in the enjoyment of the good things and circumstances \
originally designed for it by nature that it attains to completion; to these \
good things, however, sensuous gratification does not belong.<ref>Cicero, \
''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', v. 13, comp. 17, ''de Finibus'', ii. 11; Seneca, \
''Epistulae'', 85</ref> In this sense he on the one hand denoted (perfect) \
happiness as the possession of personal virtue, and the capabilities adapted \
to it, and therefore reckoned among its constituent elements, besides moral \
actions conditions and facilities, those movements and relations also without \
which external good things cannot be attained,<ref>Clement of Alexandria, \
''Stromata'', ii.; comp. Cicero, ''de Finibus'', iv. 7, v. 9, ''Academica'', \
ii. 44, 45, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', iv. 10, 26, 31</ref> and on the other \
hand did not allow that wisdom, understood as the science of first causes or \
intelligible essence, or as theoretical understanding, is by itself the true \
wisdom which should be striven after by people,<ref>Clement of Alexandria, \
''Stromata''; Cicero, ''Academica'', ii. 44, 45</ref> and therefore seems to \
have regarded this human wisdom as at the same time exerted in investigating, \
defining, and applying.<ref>Aristotle, ''Topica'', vi. 3</ref> How decidedly \
he insisted not only on the recognition of the unconditional nature of moral \
excellence, but on morality of thought, is shown by his declaration, that it \
comes to the same thing whether one casts longing eyes, or sets one's feet \
upon the property of others.<ref>Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', xiv. 42</ref> \
His moral earnestness is also expressed in the warning that the ears of \
children should be guarded against the poison of immoral \
speeches.<ref>Plutarch, ''de \
Audit.''</ref>\\n\\n===Mathematics===\\nXenocrates is known to have written a \
book ''On Numbers'', and a ''Theory of Numbers'', besides books on \
[[geometry]].{{sfn|La\[EDoubleDot]rtius|1925|loc=\[Section] 13, 14}} \
[[Plutarch]] writes that Xenocrates once attempted to find the total number \
of syllables that could be made from the letters of the \
alphabet.<ref>Plutarch, ''Quaest. Conviv.''</ref> According to Plutarch, \
Xenocrates result was 1,002,000,000,000 (a \\\"[[myriad]]-and-twenty times a \
myriad-myriad\\\"). This possibly represents the first instance that a \
combinatorial problem involving [[permutations]] was attempted. Xenocrates \
also supported the idea of \\\"indivisible lines\\\" (and magnitudes) in \
order to counter [[Zeno's paradoxes]].<ref>Simplicius, ''in Arist. \
Phys.''</ref>\\n\\n==See also==\\n*''[[On Indivisible \

and work ==\\nDinostratus' chief contribution to mathematics was his solution \

made use of the [[trisectrix]] of [[Hippias]], for which he proved a special \
property ([[Dinostratus' theorem]]) that allowed him the squaring of the \
circle. Due to his work the trisectrix later became known as the \
[[quadratrix]] of Dinostratus as well.<ref name=\\\"Dinostratus\\\"/> \
Although Dinostratus solved the problem of squaring the circle, he did not do \
so using [[Compass and straightedge constructions|ruler and compass]] alone, \
and so it was clear to the Greeks that his solution violated the foundational \
principles of their mathematics.<ref name=\\\"Dinostratus\\\">{{cite \

\[Dash]97|quote = Dinostratus, brother of Menaechmus, was also a \
mathematician, and where one of the brothers \\\"solved\\\" the duplication \

quadrature because a simple matter once a striking property of the end point \
''Q'' of the trisectrix of Hippias had been noted, apparently by Dinostratus. \
If the equation of the trisectrix (Fig. 6.4) is \[Pi]rsin \[Theta] = 2a\
\[Theta], where a is the side of the square ABCD associated with the curve, \
[...] hence, Dinostratus' theorem is established - that is, AC/AB = AB/DQ. \
[...] Inasmuch as Dinostratus showed that the trisectrix of Hippias serves to \
square the circle, the curve more commonly came to be known as the \
quadratrix. It was, of course, always clear to the Greeks that the use of the \
curve in the trisection and quadrature problems violated the rules of the \
game - that circles and straight lines only were permitted. The \
\\\"solution\\\" of Hippias and Dinostratus, as their authors realized, were \
sophistic; hence, the search for further solutions, canonical or \
illegitimate, continued with the result that several new curves were \
discovered by Greek geometers.}}</ref> Over 2,200 years later [[Ferdinand von \

BC){{sfn|Dorandi|1999|p=48}} was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] and \
[[astronomer]] who was born in [[Heraclea Pontica]], now [[Karadeniz \
Ere\:011fli]], [[Turkey]], and migrated to [[Athens]]. He is best remembered \
for proposing that the [[rotation of the Earth|Earth rotates]] on its axis, \
from west to east, once every 24 hours.{{sfn|Porter|2000}} He is also hailed \
as the originator of the [[heliocentric]] theory, although this is doubted by \
some.\\n\\n==Life==\\nHeraclides' father was \
Euthyphron,{{sfn|Gottschalk|1980|p=2}} a wealthy nobleman who sent his son to \
study at the [[Platonic Academy]] in [[Athens]] under its founder [[Plato]] \
and under his successor [[Speusippus]]. According to the ''[[Suda]]'', \
[[Plato]], on his departure for [[Sicily]] in 361/360 BC, left the Academy in \
the charge of Heraclides. Heraclides was nearly elected successor to \
[[Speusippus]] as head of the academy in 339/338 BC, but narrowly lost to \
[[Xenocrates]].{{sfn|Guthrie |1986|p=470}}\\n\\n==Work==\\nLike the \
[[Pythagoreans]] [[Hicetas]] and [[Ecphantus]], Heraclides proposed that the \
apparent daily motion of the stars was created by the rotation of the Earth \
on its axis once a day. This view contradicted the accepted Aristotelian \
model of the universe, which said that the earth was fixed and that the stars \
and planets in their respective spheres might also be fixed. [[Simplicius of \
Cilicia|Simplicius]]  says that Heraclides proposed that the irregular \
movements of the planets can be explained if the earth moves while the sun \
stays still.{{sfn|Simplicius|p=48}}\\n\\nAlthough some \
historians{{sfn|Heath|1921||pp=312, 316-317}} have proposed that Heraclides \
taught that [[Venus]] and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] revolve around the \
Sun, a detailed investigation of the sources has shown that \\\"nowhere in \
the ancient literature mentioning Heraclides of Pontus is there a clear \
reference for his support for any kind of heliocentrical planetary position\\\
\".{{sfn|Eastwood|1992|p=256}}\\n\\nA punning on his name, dubbing him \
Heraclides \\\"Pompicus,\\\" suggests he may have been a rather vain and \
pompous man and the target of much ridicule.{{sfn|Davidson|2007|p=45}} \
According to [[Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius]], Heraclides forged plays under \
the name of [[Thespis]], this time drawing from a different source, \
[[Dionysius the Renegade|Dionysius the Deserter]], composed plays and forged \
them under the name of [[Sophocles]]. Heraclides was deceived by this easily \
and cited from them as the words of Aeschylus and Sophocles.{{sfn|La\
\[EDoubleDot]rtius|1925|loc=\[Section] 92}} However, Heraclides seems to have \
been a versatile and prolific writer on philosophy, [[mathematics]], \
[[music]], [[grammar]], [[physics]], [[history]] and [[rhetoric]], \
notwithstanding doubts about attribution of many of the works. It appears \
that he composed various works in dialogue form.\\n\\nHeraclides also seems \
to have had an interest in the occult. In particular he focused on explaining \
trances, visions and prophecies in terms of the retribution of the gods, and \
reincarnation.{{sfn|Porter|2000}}\\n\\nA quote of Heraclides, of particular \
significance to historians, is his statement that fourth century B.C. \
[[Rome]] was a Greek city.\\n\\nHeraclides Ponticus refers with much \
admiration that Pythagoras would remember having been Pirro and before \
Euphorbus and before some other mortal.\\n\\nExcerpt from a speech by the \
character \[OpenCurlyQuote]Heraclides\[CloseCurlyQuote] in [[Protrepticus \
(Aristotle)|Protrepticus]] (Hutchinson and Johnson, \
2015){{sfn|Hutchinson|Johnson|2015}}\\n:''So nothing divine or happy belongs \
to humans apart from just that one thing worth taking seriously, as much \
insight and intelligence as is in us, for, of what\[CloseCurlyQuote]s ours, \
this alone seems to be immortal, and this alone divine.  And by being able to \
share in such a capacity, our way of life, although by nature miserable and \
difficult, is yet so gracefully managed that, in comparison with the other \
animals, a human seems to be a god.'' (p. \

\\\"Father of Western Philosophy\\\", which inherited almost its entire \
lexicon from his teachings, including problems and methods of inquiry, so \
influencing almost all forms of knowledge.\\n\\nLittle is known for certain \
about his life. His father, [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], \
died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At \
seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined [[Plato's Academy]] in Athens \
and remained there until the age of thirty-seven ([[Circa|c.]] 347 BC).<ref \

opportunities. He established a library in the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] \
which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books, which were \
[[papyrus]] [[scrolls]]. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato \
contributed to his former views of [[Platonism]], but, following Plato's \
death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from \
Platonism to [[empiricism]].{{sfn|Barnes|1995|p=16}} He believed all concepts \
and knowledge were ultimately based on [[perception]]. Aristotle's views on \
[[natural science]]s represent the groundwork underlying many of his \
works.\\n\\nAristotle's views on [[Aristotelian physics|physical science]] \
profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Their influence extended from [[Late \
Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]] into the [[Renaissance]], and were \
not replaced systematically until [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] \
and theories such as [[classical mechanics]]. Some of Aristotle's \
[[zoology|zoological]] observations, such as on the [[Hectocotylus|hectocotyl \
(reproductive) arm]] of the [[octopus]], were disbelieved until the 19th \
century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, studied \
by medieval scholars such as [[Peter Abelard]] and [[John Buridan]]. \
[[Aristotelianism]] profoundly influenced [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800\
\[Dash]1400)|Islamic thought]] during the [[Middle Ages]], as well as \
[[Christian theology]], especially the [[Neoplatonism]] of the [[Early \
Church]] and the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Catholic \
Church]]. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as \\\"The \
First Teacher\\\". His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed \
interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]].\\n\\nAll aspects of \
Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of academic study. Though \
Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only \
around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for \
publication.{{sfn|Barnes|1995|p=9}} Aristotle has been depicted by major \
artists including [[Raphael]] and [[Rembrandt]]. [[Early Modern]] theories \
including [[William Harvey]]'s [[circulation of the blood]] and [[Galileo \
Galilei]]'s [[kinematics]] were developed in reaction to Aristotle's. In the \
19th century, [[George Boole]] gave Aristotle's logic a mathematical \
foundation with his system of [[Boolean algebra|algebraic logic]]. In the \
20th century, [[Martin Heidegger]] created a new interpretation of \
Aristotle's political philosophy, but elsewhere Aristotle was widely \
criticised, even ridiculed by thinkers such as the philosopher [[Bertrand \
Russell]] and the biologist [[Peter Medawar]]. More recently, Aristotle has \
again been taken seriously, such as in the thinking of [[Ayn Rand]] and \
[[Alasdair MacIntyre]], while [[Armand Marie Leroi]] has reconstructed \
[[Aristotle's biology]]. The image of Aristotle tutoring the young Alexander \
remains current, as in the 2004 film [[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]], and \
the ''Poetics'' continues to play a role in the [[cinema of the United \
States]].\\n\\n== Life ==\\n[[File:20160518 092 mieza \

teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the [[Universality \
(philosophy)|universal]]. Aristotle's [[ontology]] places the universal \
(''katholou'') in [[particular]]s (''kath' hekaston''), things in the world, \
whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual \
things imitate. This means that Aristotle's [[epistemology]] is based on the \
study of things that exist or happen in the world, and rises to knowledge of \
the universal, whereas for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of \
universal [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of \
particular imitations of these.<ref name=SEParistotle-logic/> For Aristotle, \

philosophy\\\" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the \
natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, \
biology and other natural sciences. Aristotle's work encompassed virtually \
all facets of intellectual inquiry. Aristotle makes philosophy in the broad \
sense coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as \\\"science\
\\\". Note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different \
meaning than that covered by the term \\\"scientific method\\\". For \
Aristotle, \\\"all science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or \
theoretical\\\" (''Metaphysics'' 1025b25). His practical science includes \
ethics and politics; his poetical science means the study of fine arts \
including poetry; his theoretical science covers physics, mathematics and \
metaphysics.<ref \

called it \\\"first philosophy\\\", and distinguished it from mathematics and \
natural science (physics) as the contemplative (''theoretik\[EBar]'') \
philosophy which is \\\"theological\\\" and studies the divine. He wrote in \
his ''Metaphysics'' (1026a16):\\n:if there were no other independent things \
besides the composite natural ones, the study of nature would be the primary \
kind of knowledge; but if there is some motionless independent thing, the \
knowledge of this precedes it and is first philosophy, and it is universal \
''in just this way'', because it is first. And it belongs to this sort of \
philosophy to study being as being, both what it is and what belongs to it \
just by virtue of being.<ref>{{citation|author=Aristotle|title=Aristotle's \

\\\"the what it was to be\\\") in his ''Metaphysics'' (Book VII), and he \
concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and \
form, a philosophical theory called [[hylomorphism]]. In Book VIII, he \
distinguishes the matter of the substance as the [[Material \
substratum|substratum]], or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, \
the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever \
constitutes the ''potential'' house, while the form of the substance is the \
''actual'' house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other \
[[Genus-differentia definition|differentia]] that let us define something as \
a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, \
and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the \

change he introduces the concept of potentiality (''[[Dunamis|dynamis]]'') \
and actuality (''[[entelecheia]]'') in association with the matter and the \
form. Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or \
being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by \
something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially \
(''dynamei'') plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a \
plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (''poiein'') or 'be acted upon' \
(''paschein''), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes \
possess the potentiality of sight (innate \[Dash] being acted upon), while \
the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise \
\[Dash] acting). Actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality. \
Because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and for the \
sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. \
Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is \
when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.<ref \
name=SEPactupote/>\\n\\n<blockquote>For that for the sake of which (''to hou \
heneka'') a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of \
the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that \
the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may \
have sight, but they have sight that they may see.<ref>Aristotle, \
''Metaphysics'' IX 1050a 5\[Dash]10</ref></blockquote>\\n\\nIn summary, the \
matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the \
activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which \
is also a [[final cause]] or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that \
the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in \
substantiality. With this definition of the particular substance (i.e., \
matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the \
beings, for example, \\\"what is it that makes a man one\\\"? Since, \
according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a \
unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the \
actual one (form) are one and the same.<ref name=SEPactupote/><ref>Aristotle, \

Aristotle, both matter and form belong to the individual thing \
([[hylomorphism]]).]]\\n{{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}\\n\\nPlato \
argued that all things have a [[Theory of forms|universal form]], which could \
be either a property or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, \
for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyse a form of an apple. In \
this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an \
apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak \
of both the book and apple as being next to each other. Plato argued that \
there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For \
example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but \\\
\"good\\\" is still a proper universal form. Aristotle disagreed with Plato \
on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of \
time, and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing \
things. In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of \
universals. Where Plato spoke of the world of forms, a place where all \
universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within \
each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, \
the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the \
forms.<ref name=SEPsubstuniv>{{cite SEP \

the material out of which something is composed. Thus the material cause of a \
table is wood. It is not about action. It does not mean that one domino \
knocks over another domino.<ref name=Lloyd1996fourcauses/>\\n* The [[formal \
cause]] is its form, i.e., the arrangement of that matter. It tells us what a \
thing is, that a thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, \
essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in \
terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., \
macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the \
whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea in the mind \
of the sculptor that brings the sculpture into being. A simple example of the \
formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or \
engineer to create a drawing.<ref name=Lloyd1996fourcauses/>\\n* The \
[[efficient cause]] is \\\"the primary source\\\", or that from which the \
change under consideration proceeds. It identifies 'what makes of what is \
made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of \
agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or \
rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of \
cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of \\\"cause\\\" as \
either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. In the \
case of two dominoes, when the first is knocked over it causes the second \
also to fall over.<ref name=Lloyd1996fourcauses/> In the case of animals, \

[[final cause]] (''telos'') is its purpose, the reason why a thing exists or \

The final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to \
serve. This covers modern ideas of motivating causes, such as volition.<ref \

a different style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering \
patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal \
explanations from \
these.{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=365\[Dash]368}}{{sfn|Taylor|1922|page=49}} This \
style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available \
in a new field, such as [[genomics]]. It does not result in the same \
certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and \
constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, \
Aristotle's biology is \
scientific.{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=365\[Dash]368}}\\n\\nFrom the data he \
collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of [[biological \
rules|rules]] relating the life-history features of the live-bearing \
tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these \
correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body \
mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a \
mouse. [[Life expectancy|Lifespan]] increases with [[gestation period]], and \
also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer \
period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, [[fecundity]] \
decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young \
in total than short-lived kinds like mice.{{sfn|Leroi|2015|page=408}}{{-}}\\n\

crustacea (non-shelled \[Dash] cephalopods, and [[crustacea|shelled]]) and \

the Soul}}\\n[[File:Aristotelian Soul.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Aristotle \
proposed a three-part [[Soul#Aristotle|structure for souls]] of plants, \
animals, and humans, making humans unique in having all three types of \
soul.]]\\n\\nAristotle's [[psychology]], given in his treatise ''[[On the \
Soul]]'' (''peri psyche''), posits three kinds of [[soul]] (\\\"psyches\\\"): \
the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. Humans have a \
rational soul. The human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds: \
Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive \
soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the \
human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to \
compare them using the ''[[Nous#Aristotle|nous]]'' (intellect) and ''logos'' \
(reason).{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=156\[Dash]163}}\\n\\nFor Aristotle, the soul \
is the [[Hylomorphism#Body\[Dash]soul hylomorphism|form]] of a living being. \
Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living \
beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. \
the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and \
chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of \
movement).<ref>{{cite SEP|url-id=aristotle-psychology |title=Psychology \

philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, he placed the rational \

Aristotle in ''On the Soul'', memory is the ability to hold a perceived \
experience in your mind and to distinguish between the internal \
\\\"appearance\\\" and an occurrence in the past.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bloch \

|isbn=978-90-04-16046-0 |ref=harv}}</ref> In other words, a memory is a \
mental picture ([[wikt:phantasm|phantasm]]) that can be recovered. Aristotle \
believed an impression is left on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes \
several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when [[stimulus \
(psychology)|stimuli]] such as sights or sounds are so complex that the \
nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are \
the same as those involved in the operations of sensation, Aristotelian \
'[[common sense]]', and thinking.{{sfn|Bloch|2007|p=61}}<ref>{{cite book \

|isbn=978-0-521-42973-3 |ref=harv}}</ref>\\n\\nAristotle uses the term \
'memory' for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can \
develop from sensation, and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the \
impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific \
contents. Memory is of the past, prediction is of the future, and sensation \
is of the present. Retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly. A \
transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for \
our previous experience and present \
experience.{{sfn|Bloch|2007|p=25}}\\n\\nBecause Aristotle believes people \
receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions, \
people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences. To \
search for these impressions, people search the memory itself.<ref>{{cite \

memory, if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory, that \
person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. \
Recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another. \
If the chain of \\\"images\\\" is needed, one memory will stimulate the next. \
When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences \
until they reach the one that is needed.{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=25}} Recollection \
is thus the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a \
memory impression.{{sfn|Carruthers|2007|p=19}} Only humans can remember \
impressions of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. Animals that \
have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations. \
Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time \
passed.{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=296}}\\n\\n[[File:Aristotle Senses Perception \

of thought, which ends in recollection of certain impressions, was connected \
systematically in relationships such as similarity, contrast, and contiguity, \
described in his [[Laws of Association]]. Aristotle believed that past \
experiences are hidden within our mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden \
material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, \
association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the \
unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be \
recalled.{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=259}}\\n\\n====Dreams====\\n{{see \

name=Dreaming/> so it is vital to the body.<ref name=Shute1941/> While a \
person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, \
recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness. \
Since a person cannot sense during sleep they can not have desire, which is \
the result of sensation. However, the senses are able to work during \
sleep,<ref name=Shute1941/> albeit differently,<ref name=Dreaming/> unless \
they are weary.<ref name=Shute1941/>\\n\\nDreams do not involve actually \
sensing a stimulus. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered \
manner.<ref name=Shute1941/> Aristotle explains that when a person stares at \
a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water, and then look away, \
the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion. When a person \
perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their \
attention, it leaves an impression.<ref name=Dreaming/> When the body is \
awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters \
new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli \
are ignored.<ref name=Shute1941/> However, during sleep the impressions made \
throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory \
experiences.<ref name=Dreaming/> So, dreams result from these lasting \
impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact \
stimuli, dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience.<ref \
name=Modrak>{{cite journal |last1=Modrak |first1=Deborah |title=Dreams and \
Method in Aristotle |journal=Skepsis: A Journal for Philosophy and \
Interdisciplinary Research |date=2009 |volume=20 |pages=169\[Dash]181}}</ref> \
During sleep, a person is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a \
sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a \
stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may \
begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken \
by their feelings. Since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and \
unable to make judgements, they become easily deceived by what appears in \
their dreams, like the infatuated person.<ref name=Dreaming/> This leads the \
person to believe the dream is real, even when the dreams are absurd in \
nature.<ref name=Dreaming/>\\n\\nOne component of Aristotle's theory of \
dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs. He claimed that dreams are not \
foretelling and not sent by a divine being. Aristotle reasoned \
naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are \
simply coincidences.<ref name=Webb>{{cite book |last1=Webb |first1=Wilse \

|pages=174\[Dash]84}}</ref> Aristotle claimed that a dream is first \
established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it. If \
a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see \
something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake \
when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that is perceived while a \
person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example, if, while \
a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is \
shut, this sensory experience is not part of the dream. Lastly, the images of \
dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory \
experiences.<ref name=\\\"Modrak\\\"/>\\n\\n==Practical \

ethics}}\\n\\nAristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than \
theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather \
than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, \
including most notably, the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.<ref>{{cite web \
|last1=Kraut |first1=Richard |title=Aristotle's Ethics \
|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/ |publisher=Stanford \
Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=19 March 2018 |date=1 May 2001}}</ref>\
\\n\\nAristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function \
(''ergon'') of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, \
because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that \
humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must \
be an activity of the ''[[De Anima|psuch\[EBar]]]'' (''soul'') in accordance \
with reason (''[[logos]]''). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity \
(the virtuous mean, between the accompanying vices of excess or \
deficiency<ref name=IEP/>) of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate \
action, ''[[eudaimonia]]'', generally translated as \\\"happiness\\\" or \
sometimes \\\"well being\\\". To have the potential of ever being happy in \
this way necessarily requires a good character (''\[EBar]thik\[EBar]'' \
''[[arete (moral virtue)|aret\[EBar]]]''), often translated as moral or \
ethical virtue or excellence.<ref>[[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book I. See for \
example chapter 7 \

3Abekker%20page%3D1098a 1098a].</ref>\\n\\nAristotle taught that to achieve a \
virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the \
fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, \
leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best \
things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical \
wisdom (''[[phronesis]]'') and their intellect (''[[nous]]'') can develop \
with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an \
accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a \
philosopher.<ref>[[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book VI.</ref>\\n\\n===Politics===\\n\
\\n{{main|Politics (Aristotle)}}\\n\\nIn addition to his works on ethics, \
which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled \
''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''. Aristotle considered the city to be a \
natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance \
to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, \\\"for the whole \
must of necessity be prior to the part\\\".<ref>Politics \
1253a19\[Dash]24</ref> He also famously stated that \\\"man is by nature a \
political animal\\\" and also arguing that humanity's defining factor among \
others in the animal kingdom is its rationality.<ref>{{cite book \

|pages=320\[Dash]21 |edition=1st |origyear=1995}}</ref> Aristotle conceived \
of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine, and as a \
collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's \
conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to \
conceive of the city in this manner.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ebenstein \

constitutions.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Aristotle's classifications of political \
constitutions]]\\n\\nThe common modern understanding of a political community \
as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle's understanding. Although \
he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural \
community according to Aristotle was the city (''[[polis]]'') which functions \
as a political \\\"community\\\" or \\\"partnership\\\" \
(''koin\:014dnia'')<!-- (1252a1) -->. The aim of the city is not just to \
avoid injustice or for economic stability<!-- (1280b29\[Dash]31) -->, but \
rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, \
and to perform beautiful acts: \\\"The political partnership must be \
regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake \
of living together<!-- (1281a1\[Dash]3) -->.\\\" This is distinguished from \
modern approaches, beginning with [[social contract]] theory, according to \
which individuals leave the [[state of nature]] because of \\\"fear of \
violent death\\\" or its \\\"inconveniences.\\\"{{refn|For a different \

related to the overall [[utility]] of social arrangements.<ref \
name=robbins2000/> Aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may \
seem beneficial to society, and that although private property is often \
blamed for social strife, such evils in fact come from [[human nature]]. In \
''Politics'', Aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of \
[[money]].<ref name=robbins2000/> Money came into use because people became \
dependent on one another, importing what they needed and exporting the \
surplus. For the sake of convenience, people then agreed to deal in something \
that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable, such as iron or \
[[silver]].<ref name=monroe1948>{{cite book |author=Aristotle |editor=Monroe, \

Economic Literature Prior to Adam Smith |date=1948 |publisher=Harvard \
University Press | pages=16\[Dash]28}}</ref>\\n\\nAristotle's discussions on \
[[retail]] and [[interest]] was a major influence on economic thought in the \
Middle Ages. He had a low opinion of retail, believing that contrary to using \
money to procure things one needs in managing the household, retail trade \
seeks to make a [[profit (economics)|profit]]. It thus uses goods as a means \
to an end, rather than as an end unto itself. He believed that retail trade \
was in this way unnatural. Similarly, Aristotle considered making a profit \
through interest unnatural, as it makes a gain out of the money itself, and \
not from its use.<ref name=monroe1948/>\\n\\nAristotle gave a summary of the \
function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time. He \
wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good \
through a count of the number of other goods it is worth, the necessity \
arises of a single universal standard of measurement. Money thus allows for \
the association of different goods and makes them \\\"commensurable\\\".<ref \
name=monroe1948/> He goes to on state that money is also useful for future \
exchange, making it a sort of security. That is, \\\"if we do not want a \
thing now, we shall be able to get it when we do want it\\\".<ref \

of a work of art and also as the product of the artist's intention<ref \
name=\\\"Halliwell2002\\\"/> and contends that the audience's realisation of \
the ''mimesis'' is vital to understanding the work itself.<ref \
name=\\\"Halliwell2002\\\"/> Aristotle states that ''mimesis'' is a natural \
instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals<ref \
name=\\\"Halliwell2002\\\"/><ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV</ref> and that all \
human artistry \\\"follows the pattern of nature\\\".<ref \
name=\\\"Halliwell2002\\\"/> Because of this, Aristotle believed that each of \
the mimetic arts possesses what [[Stephen Halliwell (academic)|Stephen \
Halliwell]] calls \\\"highly structured procedures for the achievement of \
their purposes.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Halliwell2002\\\"/> For example, music \
imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with \
rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object \
of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than \
average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, \
the forms differ in their manner of imitation \[Dash] through narrative or \
character, through change or no change, and through drama or no \
drama.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III</ref>\\n\\nWhile it is believed that \
Aristotle's ''Poetics'' originally comprised two books \[Dash] one on comedy \
and one on tragedy \[Dash] only the portion that focuses on tragedy has \
survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: \
plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric \
poetry.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' VI</ref> The characters in a tragedy are \
merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the \
chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and \
fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions. \
Aristotle concludes ''Poetics'' with a discussion on which, if either, is \
superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses \
all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such \
as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis \
in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.<ref>Aristotle, \
''Poetics'' XXVI</ref> Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, \
folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the \
riddles of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and studied the fables of \
[[Aesop]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Temple, Olivia; Temple, Robert \

influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him \
on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had \
also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his \
teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels \
made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the \
old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained \

the [[Early Modern]] period, scientists such as [[William Harvey]] in England \

based to some degree on observation and experiment. Harvey demonstrated the \
[[circulation of the blood]], establishing that the heart functioned as a \
pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the body's \
heat, as Aristotle thought.<ref name=\\\"Aird 2011\\\">{{cite journal | \

The philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]]\\nargued that \\\"almost every serious \
intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian \
doctrine\\\". Russell called Aristotle's ethics \\\"repulsive\\\", and \
labelled his logic \\\"as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy\\\". \
Russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice \
to Aristotle, until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his \
predecessors.<ref name=\\\"philosophy1972\\\"/> In 1985, the biologist \
[[Peter Medawar]] could still state in \\\"pure seventeenth \

\\\"a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay, \

\[Alpha]\[Iota]\[Chi]\[Mu]\[Omicron]\[FinalSigma]}}, 380\[Dash]320 BC) was an \
[[ancient Greek]] [[mathematician]] and [[list of geometers|geometer]] born \
in Alopeconnesus in the [[Thracian Chersonese]], who was known for his \
friendship with the renowned philosopher [[Plato]] and for his apparent \
discovery of [[conic section]]s and his solution to the then-long-standing \
problem of [[doubling the cube]] using the [[parabola]] and [[hyperbola]].\\n\
\\n== Life and work ==\\nMenaechmus is remembered by mathematicians for his \
discovery of the [[conic sections]] and his solution to the problem of \
doubling the cube.<ref>{{cite book|last = Cooke|first = Roger|authorlink = \
|title = The History of Mathematics : A Brief Course|year = 1997|chapter = \
The Euclidean Synthesis|quote = Eutocius and Proclus both attribute the \
discovery of the conic sections to Menaechmus, who lived in Athens in the \
late fourth century B.C.E. Proclus, quoting Eratosthenes, refers to \\\"the \
conic section triads of Menaechmus.\\\" Since this quotation comes just after \
a discussion of \\\"the section of a right-angled cone\\\" and  \\\"the \
section of an acute-angled cone\\\", it is inferred that the conic sections \
were produced by cutting a cone with a plane perpendicular to one of its \
elements. Then if the vertex angle of the cone is acute, the resulting \
section (called''oxytome'') is an ellipse. If the angle is right, the section \
(''orthotome'') is a parabola, and if the angle is obtuse, the section \
(''amblytome'') is a hyperbola (see Fig. 5.7).|page = 103|publisher = \
Wiley|location = New York}}</ref> Menaechmus likely discovered the conic \
sections, that is, the [[ellipse]], the [[parabola]], and the [[hyperbola]], \
as a by-product of his search for the solution to the [[Delian problem]].<ref \
name=\\\"Boyer Menaechmus\\\">{{cite book|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin \
Boyer|title=A History of Mathematics|year=1991|chapter=The age of Plato and \
Aristotle|quote=It was consequently a signal achievement on the part of \
Menaechmus when he disclosed that curves having the desired property were \
near at hand. In fact, there was a family of appropriate curves obtained from \
a single source - the cutting of a right circular cone by a plane \
perpendicular to an element of the cone. That is, Menaechmus is reputed to \
have discovered the curves that were later known as the ellipse, the \
parabola, and the hyperbola. [...] Yet the first discovery of the ellipse \
seems to have been made by Menaechmus as a mere by-product in a search in \
which it was the parabola and hyperbola that proffered the properties needed \
in the solution of the Delian problem.|page=93}}</ref> Menaechmus knew that \
in a parabola y<sup>2</sup> = ''L''x, where ''L'' is a constant called the \
''[[latus rectum]]'', although he was not aware of the fact that any equation \
in two unknowns determines a curve.<ref name=\\\"Boyer Menaechmus 2\\\"/> He \
apparently derived these properties of conic sections and others as well. \
Using this information it was now possible to find a solution to the problem \
of the [[duplication of the cube]] by solving for the points at which two \
parabolas intersect, a solution equivalent to solving a cubic equation.<ref \
name=\\\"Boyer Menaechmus 2\\\">{{cite book|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl \
Benjamin Boyer|title=A History of Mathematics |year=1991|chapter=The age of \
Plato and Aristotle|pages=94\[Dash]95|quote=If OP=y and OD = x are \
coordinates of point P, we have y<sup>2</sup> = R).OV, or, on substituting \
equals, y<sup>2</sup> = R'D.OV = AR'.BC/AB.DO.BC/AB = \
AR'.BC<sup>2</sup>/AB<sup>2</sup>.In as much as segments AR', BC, and AB are \
the same for all points P on the curve EQDPG, we can write the equation of \
the curve, a \\\"section of a right-angled cone\\\", as y<sup>2</sup>=lx, \
where l is a constant, later to be known as the ''latus rectum'' of the \
curve. [...] Menaechmus apparently derived these properties of the conic \
sections and others as well. Since this material has a strong resemblance to \
the use of coordinates, as illustrated above, it has sometimes been maintains \
that Menaechmus had analytic geometry. Such a judgment is warranted only in \
part, for certainly Menaechmus was unaware that any equation in two unknown \
quantities determines a curve. In fact, the general concept of an equation in \
unknown quantities was alien to Greek thought. [...] He had hit upon the \
conics in a successful search for curves with the properties appropriate to \
the duplication of the cube. In terms of modern notation the solution is \
easily achieved. By shifting the cutting plane (Fig. 6.2), we can find a \
parabola with any latus rectum. If, then, we wish to duplicate a cube of edge \
a, we locate on a right-angled cone two parabolas, one with latus rectum \
''a'' and another with latus rectum 2''a''. [...] It is probable that \
Menaechmus knew that the duplication could be achieved also by the use of a \
rectangular hyperbola and a parabola.}}</ref>\\n\\nThere are few direct \
sources for Menaechmus's work; his work on conic sections is known primarily \
from an [[epigram]] by [[Eratosthenes]], and the accomplishment of his \
brother (of devising a method to create a square equal in area to a given \
circle using the [[quadratrix]]), [[Dinostratus]], is known solely from the \
writings of [[Proclus]]. Proclus also mentions that Menaechmus was taught by \
[[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]]. There is a curious statement by [[Plutarch]] \
to the effect that Plato disapproved of Menaechmus achieving his doubled cube \
solution with the use of mechanical devices; the proof currently known \
appears to be purely algebraic.\\n\\nMenaechmus was said to have been the \
tutor of [[Alexander the Great]]; this belief derives from the following \
anecdote: supposedly, once, when Alexander asked him for a shortcut to \
understanding geometry, he replied \\\"O King, for traveling over the \
country, there are royal road and roads for common citizens, but in geometry \
there is one road for all.\\\" (Beckmann, ''A History of Pi'', 1989, \
p.&nbsp;34) However, this quote is first attested by [[Stobaeus]], about 500 \
AD, and so whether Menaechmus really taught Alexander is \
uncertain.\\n\\nWhere precisely he died is uncertain as well, though modern \
scholars believe that he eventually expired in [[Cyzicus]].\\n\\n== \

BC) was a [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomer]] and \
[[mathematician]].\\n\\n==Biography==\\nCallippus was born at [[Cyzicus]], \
and studied under [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] at the [[Academy]] of [[Plato]]. He \
also worked with [[Aristotle]] at the [[Lyceum]], which means that he was \
active in [[Athens]] prior to Aristotle's death in 322. He observed the \
movements of the planets and attempted to use Eudoxus' scheme of connected \
spheres to account for their movements. However he found that 27 spheres was \
insufficient to account for the planetary movements, and so he added seven \
more for a total of 34. According to the description in Aristotle's \
''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' (XII.8), he added two spheres for \
the Sun, two for the Moon, and one each for Mercury, Venus, and \
Mars.\\n\\nCallippus made careful measurements of the lengths of the seasons, \
finding them (starting with the spring [[equinox]]) to be 94 days, 92 days, \
89 days, and 90 days.  This variation in the seasons implies a variation in \
the speed of the Sun, called the '''solar anomaly'''.  He also followed up on \
the work done by [[Meton of Athens]] to measure the length of the year and \
construct an accurate [[lunisolar calendar]].  The [[Metonic cycle]] has 19 \
[[tropical year]]s and 235 [[synodic month]]s in 6940 days.  The [[Callippic \
cycle]] synchronizes days per orbit and rotations per orbit within the \
Metonic cycle, noting the difference of one after 4 Metonic cycles, a \
duration of 76 years.  Distinguishing rotations and days infers knowledge of \
the precession cycle.\\n\\nCallippus started his observation cycle on the \
summer solstice, 330 BC, (28 June in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]]).  The \
cycle's begin position, the stellar position and sidereal hour timing the \
eclipse, are used by later astronomers for calibrating their observations in \
relation to subsequent eclipses. The Callippic cycle of 76 years appears to \
be used in the [[Antikythera mechanism]], an ancient astronomical mechanical \
clock and observational aide of the 2nd century BC (discovered in \
Mediterranean waters off Greece). The mechanism has a dial for the Callippic \
cycle and the 76 years are mentioned in the Greek text of the manual of this \
old device. The crater [[Calippus (crater)|Calippus]] on the [[Moon]] is \
named after him.\\n\\n==References==\\n*Kieffer, John S. \\\"Callippus.\\\" \

   ",", "\<\"'''Eudemus of Rhodes''' ({{lang-grc-gre|\[CapitalEpsilon]\:1f54\
\[Delta]\[Eta]\[Mu]\[Omicron]\[FinalSigma]}}) was an [[ancient Greek]] \
philosopher, considered the first historian of science, who lived from c. 370 \
BC until c. 300 BC. He was one of Aristotle's most important pupils, editing \
his teacher's work and making it more easily accessible. Eudemus' nephew, \
Pasicles, was also credited with editing Aristotle's \
works.\\n\\n==Life==\\nEudemus was born on the isle of [[Rhodes]], but spent \
a large part of his life in [[Athens]], where he studied philosophy at \
[[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic School]]. \
Eudemus's collaboration with Aristotle was long-lasting and close, and he was \
generally considered to be one of Aristotle's most brilliant pupils: he and \
[[Theophrastus|Theophrastus of Lesbos]] were regularly called not Aristotle's \
\\\"disciples\\\", but his \\\"companions\\\" (\:1f11\[Tau]\[Alpha]\:1fd6\
\[Rho]\[Omicron]\[Iota]).\\n\\nIt seems that Theophrastus was the greater \
genius of the two, continuing Aristotle's studies in a wide range of areas. \
Although Eudemus too conducted original research, his ''forte'' lay in \
systematizing Aristotle's philosophical legacy, and in a clever didactical \
presentation of his teacher's ideas. Later authors who wrote commentaries on \
Aristotle often made good use of Eudemus's preliminary work. It is for this \
reason that, though Eudemus's writings themselves are not extant, we know \
many citations and testimonia regarding his work, and are thus able to build \
up a picture of him and his work.\\n\\nAristotle, shortly before his death in \
322 BC, designated Theophrastus to be his successor as head of the \
Peripatetic School. Eudemus then returned to Rhodes, where he founded his own \
philosophical school, continued his own philosophical research, and went on \
editing Aristotle's work.\\n\\n==Historian of science==\\nAt the insistence \
of Aristotle, Eudemus wrote histories of Greek mathematics and astronomy. \
Though only fragments of these have survived, included in the works of later \
authors, their value is immense. It is only because later authors used \
Eudemus's writings that we still are informed about the early history and \
development of Greek science. In his historical writings Eudemus showed how \
the purely practically oriented knowledge and skills that earlier peoples \
such as the Egyptians and the Babylonians had known, were by the Greeks given \
a theoretical basis, and built into a coherent and comprehensive \
philosophical building.\\n\\n*As regards his  ''History of Arithmetics'' (\
\:0386\[Rho]\[Iota]\[Theta]\[Mu]\[Eta]\[Tau]\[Iota]\[Kappa]\:1f74 \:1f31\
\[Sigma]\[Tau]\[Omicron]\[Rho]\:03af\[Alpha]) we only have the tiniest bit of \
information: there is only one testimonium, saying that Eudemus mentions the \
discovery by the [[Pythagoras|Pythagoreans]] that it is possible to connect \
musical intervals with integer numbers.\\n*Eudemus's ''History of Geometry'' \
(\[CapitalGamma]\[CurlyEpsilon]\[Omega]\[Mu]\[CurlyEpsilon]\[Tau]\[Rho]\[Iota]\
\[Kappa]\:1f74 \:1f31\[Sigma]\[Tau]\[Omicron]\[Rho]\:03af\[Alpha]) is \
mentioned by many more writers, including [[Proclus]], [[Simplicius of \
Cilicia|Simplicius]], and [[Pappus of Alexandria]]. From them we know that \
the book treated the work by, among others, [[Thales of Miletus]], the \
Pythagoreans, [[Oenopides of Chios]], and [[Hippocrates of Chios]]. Among the \
topics Eudemus discussed were the discovery of geometrical theorems and \
constructions (systematized in Eudemus's days by [[Euclid]] in his \
''Elements''), and the classical problems of Greek geometry, such as the \
[[quadrature of the circle]] and the [[duplication of the cube]].\\n*We know \
much about Eudemus's ''History of Astronomy'' (\:0386\[Sigma]\[Tau]\[Rho]\
\[Omicron]\[Lambda]\[Omicron]\[Gamma]\[Iota]\[Kappa]\:1f74 \:1f31\[Sigma]\
\[Tau]\[Omicron]\[Rho]\:03af\[Alpha]), from sources such as [[Theon of \
Smyrna]], Simplicius, [[Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius]], [[Clement of \
Alexandria]], and others. Building upon those data we can reconstruct with \
some accuracy the astronomical discoveries that were made in Greece between \
600 and 350 BC, as well as the theories that were developed in that period \
regarding the earth, solar and lunar [[eclipse]]s, the movements of the \
heavenly bodies, etcetera. Philosophers and astronomers treated by Eudemus \
include Thales, [[Anaximander]], [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], \
Oenopides, [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]], and others.\\n\\nTwo other \
historical works are attributed to Eudemus, but here his authorship is not \
certain. First, he is said to have written a ''History of Theology'', that \
discussed the Babylonian, Egyptian, and Greek ideas regarding the origins of \
the universe. Secondly, he is said to have been the author of a ''History of \
Lindos'' (Lindos is a port on Rhodes).\\n\\nTo Eudemus is also ascribed a \
book with miraculous stories about animals and their human-like properties \
(exemplary braveness, ethical sensitivity, and the like). However, as the \
character of this work does not at all fit in with the serious scientific \
approach that is apparent from Eudemus's other works, it is generally held \
that Eudemus of Rhodes cannot have been the author of this book (it may have \
been another Eudemus \[LongDash] his was a fairly common name in ancient \
Greece).\\n\\n==Editor of Aristotle's work==\\nEudemus, Theophrastus, and \
other pupils of Aristotle took care that the intellectual heritage of their \
master after his death would remain accessible in a reliable form, by \
recording it in a long series of publications. These were based on \
Aristotle's writings, their own lecture notes, personal recollections, \
etcetera.\\n\\nThus one of Aristotle's writings is still called the \
''[[Eudemian Ethics]]'', probably because it was Eudemus who edited (though \
very lightly) this text. More important, Eudemus wrote a number of \
influential books that clarified Aristotle's works:\\n\\n*Eudemus's \
''Physics'' (\[CapitalPhi]\[Upsilon]\[Sigma]\[Iota]\[Kappa]\:03ac) was a \
compact, and more didactical version of Aristotle's homonymous work.\\n* \
Eudemus wrote two or three books dealing with logics (''Analytics'' and \
''Categories'' (possibly the same book), and ''On discourse'' (\[CapitalPi]\
\[CurlyEpsilon]\[Rho]\[Iota] \[Lambda]\[CurlyEpsilon]\[Xi]\[CurlyEpsilon]\
\[Omega]\[FinalSigma])), which probably expounded Aristotle's ideas. \\n* \
Finally, a geometrical work, ''On the angle'' (\[CapitalPi]\[CurlyEpsilon]\
\[Rho]\:1f76 \[Gamma]\[Omega]\[Nu]\:03af\[Alpha]\[FinalSigma]).\\n\\nA \
comparison between the Eudemus fragments and their corresponding parts in the \
works of Aristotle shows that Eudemus was a gifted teacher: he systematizes \
subject matter, leaves out digressions that distract from the main theme, \
adds specific examples to illustrate abstract statements, formulates in \
catching phrases, and occasionally inserts a joke to keep the reader \
attentive.\\n\\n==References==\\n\\n* Istvan Bodnar, William W. Fortenbaugh \

several pupils of Plato (particularly [[Theaetetus \

Euclid is not much younger than these, and that he must have lived during the \
time of [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy I]] because he was mentioned by \
[[Archimedes]] (287\[Dash]212&nbsp;BC). Although the apparent citation of \

biographical information is unusual for the period (extensive biographies are \
available for most significant Greek mathematicians for several centuries \
before and after Euclid), some researchers have proposed that Euclid was not, \

mathematicians who took the name Euclid from the historical character \
[[Euclid of Megara]] (compare [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]). However, this \

the results in ''Elements'' originated with earlier mathematicians, one of \
Euclid's accomplishments was to present them in a single, logically coherent \

centuries later.<ref>Struik p.&nbsp;51 (\\\"their logical structure has \

primary, held by the Vatican, mentions no author. The only reference that \
historians rely on of Euclid having written the ''Elements'' was from \
Proclus, who briefly in his ''Commentary on the Elements'' ascribes Euclid as \
its author.\\n\\nAlthough best known for its geometric results, the \
''Elements'' also includes [[number theory]]. It considers the connection \
between [[perfect numbers]] and [[Mersenne primes]] (known as the [[Euclid\
\[Dash]Euler theorem]]), the [[Euclid's theorem|infinitude of prime \
numbers]], [[Euclid's lemma]] on factorization (which leads to the \
[[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] on uniqueness of [[integer \
factorization|prime factorizations]]), and the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for \
finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers.\\n\\nThe geometrical \
system described in the ''Elements'' was long known simply as \
''[[geometry]]'', and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today, \
however, that system is often referred to as ''[[Euclidean geometry]]'' to \
distinguish it from other so-called ''[[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean \

those under a lesser angle less, while those under equal angles appear equal.\
\\\" In the 36 propositions that follow, Euclid relates the apparent size of \
an object to its distance from the eye and investigates the apparent shapes \
of cylinders and cones when viewed from different angles. Proposition 45 is \
interesting, proving that for any two unequal magnitudes, there is a point \
from which the two appear equal. [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] believed \
these results to be important in astronomy and included Euclid's ''Optics'', \
along with his ''Phaenomena'', in the ''Little Astronomy'', a compendium of \
smaller works to be studied before the ''Syntaxis'' (''Almagest'') of \
[[Claudius Ptolemy]].\\n\\n=== Lost works ===\\nOther works are credibly \
attributed to Euclid, but have been lost.\\n* ''Conics'' was a work on \
[[conic section]]s that was later extended by [[Apollonius of Perga]] into \
his famous work on the subject. It is likely that the first four books of \
Apollonius's work come directly from Euclid. According to Pappus, \
\\\"Apollonius, having completed Euclid's four books of conics and added four \
others, handed down eight volumes of conics.\\\" The Conics of Apollonius \
quickly supplanted the former work, and by the time of Pappus, Euclid's work \
was already lost.\\n* ''[[Porism]]s'' might have been an outgrowth of \
Euclid's work with conic sections, but the exact meaning of the title is \
controversial.\\n* ''Pseudaria'', or ''Book of Fallacies'', was an elementary \
text about errors in [[reasoning]].\\n* ''Surface Loci'' concerned either \
[[Locus (mathematics)|loci]] (sets of points) on surfaces or loci which were \
themselves surfaces; under the latter interpretation, it has been \
hypothesized that the work might have dealt with [[Quadric|quadric \
surfaces]].\\n* Several works on [[mechanics]] are attributed to Euclid by \
Arabic sources. ''On the Heavy and the Light'' contains, in nine definitions \
and five propositions, Aristotelian notions of moving bodies and the concept \
of specific gravity. ''On the Balance'' treats the theory of the lever in a \
similarly Euclidean manner, containing one definition, two axioms, and four \
propositions. A third fragment, on the circles described by the ends of a \
moving lever, contains four propositions. These three works complement each \
other in such a way that it has been suggested that they are remnants of a \
single treatise on mechanics written by Euclid.\\n\\n==Legacy==\\nThe \

geocentrism. [[Thomas Little Heath|Thomas Heath]] gives the following English \

circumference of a circle, the sun lying in the middle of the orbit'', and \
that the sphere of the fixed stars, situated about the same centre as the \

dichotomy) ==\\n[[File:Aristarchus \
working.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Aristarchus's 3rd-century BC calculations on \
the relative sizes of (from left) the Sun, Earth and Moon, from a \
10th-century AD Greek copy]]\\n{{main article|Aristarchus On the Sizes and \
Distances}}\\n\\nThe only known surviving work usually attributed to \
Aristarchus, ''[[Aristarchus On the Sizes and Distances|On the Sizes and \
Distances of the Sun and Moon]]'', is based on a geocentric [[world view]]. \
It has historically been read as stating that the angle subtended by the \
Sun's diameter is two degrees, but [[Archimedes]] states in ''[[The Sand \
Reckoner]]'' that Aristarchus had a value of \.bd degree, which is much \
closer to the actual average value of 32' or 0.53 degrees. The discrepancy \
may come from a misinterpretation of what unit of measure was meant by a \
certain Greek term in the text of \
Aristarchus.<ref>http://www.dioi.org/vols/we0.pdf</ref>\\n\\nAristarchus \
claimed that at half moon ([[lunar phase|first or last quarter moon]]), the \
angle between the Sun and Moon was 87\[Degree].<ref>''Greek Mathematical \
Works'', Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University, 1939\[Dash]1941, edited \
by Ivor Thomas, volume 2 (1941), pages 6\[Dash]7</ref> He might have proposed \
87\[Degree] as a lower bound, since gauging the lunar [[terminator \
(solar)|terminator]]'s deviation from linearity to one degree of accuracy is \
beyond the unaided human ocular limit (with that limit being about three \
degrees of accuracy). Aristarchus is known to have also studied light and \
vision.<ref>Heath, 1913, pp. 299\[Dash]300; Thomas, 1942, pp. \
2\[Dash]3.</ref>\\n\\nUsing correct [[geometry]], but the insufficiently \
accurate 87\[Degree] [[Datum (geodesy)|datum]], Aristarchus concluded that \
the Sun was between 18 and 20 times farther away than the \
Moon.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXHxx8L9YFo A video on \
reconstruction of Aristarchus' method, in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] \
without subtitles.]</ref> (The true value of this angle is close to 89\
\[Degree]&nbsp;50', and the Sun's distance is actually about 400 times that \
of the Moon.) The implicit false solar parallax of slightly under three \
degrees was used by astronomers up to and including [[Tycho Brahe]], \
c.&nbsp;AD&nbsp;1600. Aristarchus pointed out that the Moon and Sun have \
nearly equal apparent angular sizes, and therefore their diameters must be in \
proportion to their distances from Earth; thus, the diameter of the Sun was \
calculated to be between 18 and 20 times the diameter of the Moon.<ref>{{cite \

of how he invented a method for determining the volume of an object with an \
irregular shape. According to [[Vitruvius]], a [[votive crown]] for a temple \
had been made for [[Hiero II of Syracuse|King Hiero II of Syracuse]], who had \
supplied the pure [[gold]] to be used, and Archimedes was asked to determine \
whether some [[silver]] had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith.<ref \

damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body \
in order to calculate its [[density]].\\nWhile taking a bath, he noticed that \
the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in, and realized that this \
effect could be used to determine the [[volume]] of the crown. For practical \
purposes water is incompressible,<ref>{{cite web|title = Incompressibility of \

its own volume. By dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water \
displaced, the density of the crown could be obtained. This density would be \
lower than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added. \

the crown to that of pure gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a pure \
gold reference sample of the same weight, then immersing the apparatus in \
water. The difference in density between the two samples would cause the \
scale to tip accordingly. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] considered it \

arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of Syracuse. The Greek \
writer [[Athenaeus|Athenaeus of Naucratis]] described how King Hiero II \
commissioned Archimedes to design a huge ship, the ''[[Syracusia]]'', which \
could be used for luxury travel, carrying supplies, and as a naval warship. \
The ''Syracusia'' is said to have been the largest ship built in classical \
antiquity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Casson|first= Lionel|authorlink= Lionel \

Athenaeus, it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden \
decorations, a [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] and a temple \
dedicated to the goddess [[Aphrodite]] among its facilities. Since a ship of \
this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull, the \
[[Archimedes' screw]] was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge \
water. Archimedes' machine was a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade \
inside a cylinder. It was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer \
water from a {{nowrap|low-lying}} body of water into irrigation canals. The \
Archimedes' screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated \
solids such as coal and grain. The Archimedes' screw described in Roman times \
by [[Vitruvius]] may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used \
to irrigate the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]].<ref>{{cite web|title = \

The device, sometimes called the \\\"Archimedes heat ray\\\", was used to \
focus sunlight onto approaching ships, causing them to catch fire. In the \
modern era, similar devices have been constructed and may be referred to as a \
[[heliostat]] or [[solar furnace]].<ref>{{cite web|title =World's Largest \

sunlight onto a ship.\\n\\nA test of the Archimedes heat ray was carried out \
in 1973 by the Greek scientist Ioannis Sakkas. The experiment took place at \
the [[Skaramagas]] naval base outside [[Athens]]. On this occasion 70 mirrors \
were used, each with a copper coating and a size of around five by three feet \
(1.5 by 1&nbsp;m). The mirrors were pointed at a plywood {{nowrap|mock-up}} \
of a Roman warship at a distance of around 160&nbsp;feet (50&nbsp;m). When \
the mirrors were focused accurately, the ship burst into flames within a few \
seconds. The plywood ship had a coating of [[bitumen|tar]] paint, which may \
have aided combustion.<ref>{{cite news|title = Archimedes' Weapon| publisher \

around 100&nbsp;feet (30&nbsp;m). Flames broke out on a patch of the ship, \
but only after the sky had been cloudless and the ship had remained \
stationary for around ten minutes. It was concluded that the device was a \
feasible weapon under these conditions. The MIT group repeated the experiment \
for the television show ''[[MythBusters]]'', using a wooden fishing boat in \
[[San Francisco]] as the target. Again some charring occurred, along with a \
small amount of flame. In order to catch fire, wood needs to reach its \

that since Syracuse faces the sea towards the east, the Roman fleet would \
have had to attack during the morning for optimal gathering of light by the \
mirrors. ''MythBusters'' also pointed out that conventional weaponry, such as \
flaming arrows or bolts from a catapult, would have been a far easier way of \

129&nbsp;BC. After the capture of Syracuse ''c.'' 212&nbsp;BC, General \
[[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] is said to have taken back to Rome two \
mechanisms, constructed by Archimedes and used as aids in astronomy, which \
showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets. Cicero mentions similar \
mechanisms designed by [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]] and [[Eudoxus of \
Cnidus]]. The dialogue says that Marcellus kept one of the devices as his \
only personal loot from Syracuse, and donated the other to the Temple of \
Virtue in Rome. Marcellus' mechanism was demonstrated, according to Cicero, \
by [[Gaius Sulpicius Gallus]] to [[Lucius Furius Philus]], who described it \
thus:\\n\\n{{Text and translation|''Hanc sphaeram Gallus cum moveret, fiebat \

the Sun by as many turns on that bronze contrivance as in the sky itself, \

similar to modern [[Integral|integral calculus]]. Through proof by \
contradiction ([[reductio ad absurdum]]), he could give answers to problems \
to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which \
the answer lay. This technique is known as the [[method of exhaustion]], and \
he employed it to approximate the value of \[Pi]. In ''[[Measurement of a \
Circle]]'' he did this by drawing a larger [[regular hexagon]] outside a \
[[circle]] and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively \
doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length \
of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it \
becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, \
when the polygons had 96 sides each, he was able to determine that the value \
of \[Pi] lay between 3{{sfrac|1|7}} (approximately 3.1429) and \
3{{sfrac|10|71}} (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of \
approximately 3.1416.<ref>{{cite web|title =Archimedes on measuring the \

(approximately 1.7320512). The actual value is approximately 1.7320508, \
making this a very accurate estimate. He introduced this result without \
offering any explanation of how he had obtained it. This aspect of the work \
of Archimedes caused [[John Wallis]] to remark that he was: \\\"as it were of \

grudged posterity the secret of his method of inquiry while he wished to \

{{sfrac|4|3}} times the area of a corresponding inscribed [[triangle]] as \
shown in the figure at right. He expressed the solution to the problem as an \

{{sfrac|1|4}}:\\n\\n:<math>\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty 4^{-n} = 1 + 4^{-1} + \

term in this series is the area of the triangle, then the second is the sum \
of the areas of two triangles whose bases are the two smaller [[secant \

to {{sfrac|1|3}}.\\n\\nIn ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'', Archimedes set out to \
calculate the number of grains of sand that the universe could contain. In \
doing so, he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too \
large to be counted. He wrote: \\\"There are some, King Gelo (Gelo II, son of \
[[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]]), who think that the number of the sand is \
infinite in multitude; and I mean by the sand not only that which exists \
about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also that which is found in every \
region whether inhabited or uninhabited.\\\" To solve the problem, Archimedes \
devised a system of counting based on the [[myriad]]. The word is from the \
Greek {{lang|grc|\[Mu]\[Upsilon]\[Rho]\[Iota]\:03ac\[FinalSigma]}} \
''murias'', for the number 10,000. He proposed a number system using powers \
of a myriad of myriads (100 million) and concluded that the number of grains \
of sand required to fill the universe would be 8 [[Names of large \

described by Archimedes are not {{nowrap|self-gravitating}}, since he assumes \
the existence of a point towards which all things fall in order to derive the \
spherical shape.\\n\\n:In the second part, he calculates the equilibrium \
positions of sections of paraboloids. This was probably an idealization of \
the shapes of ships' hulls. Some of his sections float with the base under \
water and the summit above water, similar to the way that icebergs float. \
[[Archimedes' principle]] of buoyancy is given in the work, stated as \
follows: {{quote|Any body wholly or partially immersed in a fluid experiences \
an upthrust equal to, but opposite in sense to, the weight of the fluid \
displaced.}}\\n* ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]''\\n:In this work of 24 \
propositions addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes proves by two methods that \
the area enclosed by a [[parabola]] and a straight line is 4/3 multiplied by \
the area of a [[triangle]] with equal base and height. He achieves this by \
calculating the value of a [[geometric series]] that sums to infinity with \
the [[ratio]] \
{{sfrac|1|4}}.\\n[[File:Stomachion.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Ostomachion|Stomachion]\

14 pieces which can be assembled to form a [[square]]. Research published by \
Dr. Reviel Netz of [[Stanford University]] in 2003 argued that Archimedes was \
attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could be assembled into the \
shape of a square. Dr. Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a \
square 17,152 ways.<ref>{{cite news|title = In Archimedes' Puzzle, a New \

this work Archimedes uses [[Archimedes' use of \

infinite number of infinitely small parts can be used to determine its area \
or volume. Archimedes may have considered this method lacking in formal \
rigor, so he also used the [[method of exhaustion]] to derive the results. As \
with ''The Cattle Problem'', ''The Method of Mechanical Theorems'' was \
written in the form of a letter to Eratosthenes in \
[[Alexandria]].\\n\\n===Apocryphal works===\\nArchimedes' ''[[Book of \

In 1906, the Danish professor [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (historian)|Johan Ludvig \

erased older work. Palimpsests were created by scraping the ink from existing \
works and reusing them, which was a common practice in the Middle Ages as \
[[vellum]] was expensive. The older works in the palimpsest were identified \
by scholars as 10th century AD copies of previously unknown treatises by \
Archimedes.<ref>{{cite web|title = Reading Between the Lines|author= Miller, \

Cilicia]], but moved to [[Athens]] as a young man, where he became a pupil of \
[[Cleanthes]] in the Stoic school. When Cleanthes died, around 230 BC, \
Chrysippus became the third head of the school. A prolific writer, Chrysippus \

humanity within it. He adhered to a [[deterministic]] view of \
[[Destiny|fate]], but nevertheless sought a role for personal freedom in \
thought and action. Ethics, he thought, depended on understanding the nature \
of the universe, and he taught a therapy of [[wikt:extirpate|extirpating]] \
the [[Stoic passions|unruly passions]] which depress and crush the soul. He \
initiated the success of Stoicism as one of the most influential \

logic}}\\nChrysippus wrote much on the subject of logic and created a system \
of [[propositional logic]]. [[Aristotle]]'s [[term logic]] had been concerned \
with the interrelations of [[Syllogism#Terms in syllogism|terms]] such as \
\\\"Socrates\\\" or \\\"man\\\" (\\\"all men are mortal, Socrates is a man, \
so Socrates is mortal\\\"). Stoic logic, on the other hand, was concerned \
with the interrelations of [[proposition]]s such as \\\"it is day\\\" (\\\"if \
it is day, it is light: but it is day: so it is light\\\").<ref \
name=\\\"sharples24\\\">{{Harvnb|Sharples|2014|p=24}}</ref> Though the \
earlier [[Megarian school|Megarian dialecticians]] \[Dash]&nbsp;[[Diodorus \
Cronus]] and [[Philo the Dialectician|Philo]]&nbsp;\[Dash] had worked in this \
field and the pupils of [[Aristotle]] \[Dash]&nbsp;[[Theophrastus]] and \
[[Eudemus of Rhodes|Eudemus]]&nbsp;\[Dash] had investigated [[hypothetical \
syllogism]]s,<ref \
name=\\\"johansen466\\\">{{harvnb|Johansen|Rosenmeier|1998|p=466}}</ref> it \
was Chrysippus who developed these principles into a coherent system of \
propositional logic.<ref name=\\\"johansen466\\\"/><ref name=\\\"sharples2425\
\\\">{{harvnb|Sharples|2014|pp=24\[Dash]25}}</ref>\\n\\n===Propositions===\\\
nChrysippus defined a proposition as \\\"that which is capable of being \
denied or affirmed as it is in itself\\\" and gave examples of propositions \
such as \\\"it is day\\\" and \\\"Dion is \
walking.\\\"<ref>{{harvnb|Gould|1970|pp=69\[Dash]70}}</ref> He distinguished \
between simple and non-simple propositions, which in modern terminology are \
known as [[Atomic sentence|atomic]] and [[Molecular sentence|molecular]] \
propositions.<ref name=\\\"johansen466\\\"/> A simple proposition is an \
elementary statement such as \\\"it is day.\\\"<ref \
name=\\\"gould71\\\">{{harvnb|Gould|1970|p=71}}</ref> Simple propositions are \
linked together to form non-simple propositions by the use of [[logical \
connective]]s. Chrysippus enumerated five kinds of molecular propositions \
according to the connective used:<ref name=\\\"gould71\\\"/>\\n\\n{| class=\\\
\"wikitable\\\" style=\\\"margin:1.0em \

night\\n|-\\n| because       || '''because''' it is day, it is light\\n|-\\n| \
| more/less likely ... than || '''more likely''' it is day '''than''' \
night\\n|}\\n\\nThus several types of molecular propositions, familiar to \
modern logic, were listed by Chrysippus, including the [[Logical \
conjunction|conjunction]], the [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]], and the \
[[Material conditional|conditional]],<ref \
name=\\\"johansen467\\\">{{harvnb|Johansen|Rosenmeier|1998|p=467}}</ref> and \
Chrysippus studied their criteria of [[Logical truth|truth]] closely.<ref \
name=\\\"johansen467\\\"/>\\n\\n===Conditional propositions===\\nThe first \
logicians to debate conditional statements were [[Diodorus Cronus]] and his \
pupil [[Philo the Dialectician|Philo]]. Writing five-hundred years later, \
[[Sextus Empiricus]] refers to a debate between Diodorus and Philo.<ref name=\
\\\"sextus1\\\">[[Sextus Empiricus]], ''Pyr. Hyp.'' ii. 110\[Dash]112; ''Adv. \
Math.'' viii. 112\[Dash]117</ref> Philo regarded all conditionals as true \
except those which with a correct [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] had an \
incorrect [[consequent]], and this meant a proposition such as \\\"if it is \
day, then I am talking,\\\" is true unless it is day and I fall silent.<ref \
name=\\\"sextus2\\\">Sextus Empiricus, ''Pyr. Hyp.'', ii. 110\[Dash]112</ref> \
But Diodorus argued that a true conditional is one in which the antecedent \
clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion \[Dash] thus, because the \
proposition \\\"if it is day, then I am talking\\\" can be false, it is \
invalid.<ref name=\\\"sextus1\\\"/> However, [[Paradoxes of material \
implication|paradoxical propositions]] were still possible such as \\\"if \
atomic elements of things do not exist, atomic elements exists.\\\"<ref name=\
\\\"sextus2\\\"/> Chrysippus adopted a much stricter view regarding \
conditional propositions, which made such paradoxes impossible:<ref>When \
Sextus Empiricus reports the different criteria offered by ancient \
philosophers for the truth of conditional propositions, he does not mention \
Chrysippus by name, but modern scholars believe that Chrysippus authored, or, \
at least, held this view. See {{Harvnb|Gould|1970|pp=72\[Dash]82}}</ref> to \
him, a conditional is true if denial of the consequent is logically \
incompatible with the antecedent.<ref \
name=\\\"johansen468\\\">{{Harvnb|Johansen|Rosenmeier|1998|p=468}}</ref> This \
corresponds to the modern-day [[strict conditional]].<ref \
name=\\\"johansen468\\\"/>\\n\\n===Syllogistic===\\nChrysippus developed a \
syllogistic or system of deduction in which he made use of five types of \
basic arguments or [[argument form]]s called indemonstrable syllogisms, which \
played the role of axioms, and four [[Rule of inference|inference rules]], \
called ''themata'' by means of which complex syllogisms could be reduced to \
these axioms.<ref>[[Susanne Bobzien]], Stoic Syllogistic, ''Oxford Studies in \
Ancient Philosophy'' 14, 1996, pp. 133\[Dash]192</ref> The forms of the five \
indemonstrables were:<ref>Diogenes Laertius, vii. 79; Sextus Empiricus, \

survived. One, the so-called first ''thema'', was a rule of antilogism. The \
other, the third ''thema'', was a cut rule by which chain syllogisms could be \
reduced to simple syllogisms.<ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=logic-ancient/#StoSyl \
|title=Ancient Logic: Stoic Syllogistic |last=Bobzien |first=Susanne}}</ref>  \
The purpose of Stoic syllogistic was not merely to create a formal system. It \
was also understood as the study of the operations of reason, the divine \
reason (''[[logos]]'') which governs the [[universe]], of which human beings \
are a part.<ref name=\\\"sharples26\\\">{{harvnb|Sharples|2014|p=26}}</ref> \
The goal was to find valid rules of inference and forms of proof to help \
people find their way in life.<ref name=\\\"johansen466\\\"/>\\n\\n===Other \
logical work===\\nChrysippus analyzed speech and the handling of names and \
terms.<ref name=\\\"davidson614\\\"/> He also devoted much effort in refuting \
fallacies and paradoxes.<ref name=\\\"davidson614\\\"/> According to Diogenes \
La\[EDoubleDot]rtius, Chrysippus wrote twelve works in 23 books on the [[Liar \
paradox]]; seven works in 17 books on [[amphiboly]]; and another nine works \
in 26 books on other conundrums.<ref \
name=\\\"barnes71\\\">{{Harvnb|Barnes|1999|p=71}}</ref> In all, 28 works or \
66 books were given over to puzzles or paradoxes.<ref name=\\\"barnes71\\\"/> \
\\nChrysippus is the first Stoic for whom the third of the four [[Stoic \
categories]], i.e. the category ''somehow disposed'' is attested.<ref>Stephen \
Menn, The Stoic Theory of Categories, in ''Oxford Studies in Ancient \
Philosophy: Volume XVII: 1999, 215\[Dash]47.</ref> In the surviving evidence, \
Chrysippus frequently makes use of the categories of ''substance'' and \
''quality'', but makes little use of the other two Stoic categories \
(''somehow disposed'' and ''somehow disposed in relation to something'').<ref \
name=\\\"gould107\\\">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=107}}</ref> It is not clear \
whether the categories had any special significance for Chrysippus, and a \
clear doctrine of categories may be the work of later Stoics.<ref \
name=\\\"gould107\\\"/>\\n\\n===Later reception===\\nChrysippus came to be \
renowned as one of the foremost logicians of ancient Greece. When [[Clement \
of Alexandria]] wanted to mention one who was master among logicians, as \
[[Homer]] was master among [[poet]]s, it was Chrysippus, not Aristotle, he \
chose.<ref>[[Clement of Alexandria]], ''Stromata'', vii. 16</ref> [[Diogenes \
La\[EDoubleDot]rtius]] wrote: \\\"If the gods use [[dialectic]], they would \
use none other than that of Chrysippus.\\\"<ref>Diogenes \
La\[EDoubleDot]rtius, vii. 180.</ref> The logical work by Chrysippus came to \
be neglected and forgotten. Aristotle's logic prevailed, partly because it \
was seen as more practical, and partly because it was taken up by the \
[[Neoplatonists]].<ref name=\\\"sharples26\\\"/> As recently as the 19th \
century, Stoic logic was treated with contempt, a barren formulaic system, \
which was merely clothing the logic of Aristotle with new terminology.<ref \
name=\\\"otoole403\\\">{{Harvnb|O'Toole|Jennings|2004|p=403}}</ref> It was \
not until the 20th century, with the advances in logic, and the modern \
[[propositional calculus]], that it became clear that Stoic logic constituted \
a significant achievement.<ref name=\\\"johansen466\\\"/>\\n\\n== \

can take place without a sufficient cause.<ref \
name=\\\"zeller175\\\">{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=175}}</ref> According to \
Chrysippus, every proposition is either true or false, and this must apply to \
future events as well:<ref \
name=\\\"zeller174\\\">{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=174}}</ref>\\n<blockquote>If \
any motion exists without a cause, then not every proposition will be either \
true or false. For that which has not efficient causes is neither true nor \
false. But every proposition is either true or false. Therefore, there is no \
motion without a cause. And if this is so, then all effects owe their \
existence to prior causes. And if this is so, all things happen by fate. It \
follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.<ref>Cicero, ''On \
Fate'', 20\[Dash]21</ref></blockquote>\\nThe Stoic view of fate is entirely \
based on a view of the universe as a whole. Individual things and persons \
only come into consideration as dependent parts of this whole.<ref \

every respect, determined by this relation, and is consequently subject to \
the general order of the world.<ref name=\\\"zeller176\\\"/>\\n\\nIf his \
opponents objected that, if everything is determined by destiny, there is no \
individual responsibility, since what has been once foreordained must happen, \
come what may, Chrysippus replied that there is a distinction to be made \
between simple and complex predestination.<ref \
name=\\\"zeller181\\\">{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=181}}</ref> Becoming ill may be \
fated whatever happens but, if a person's recovery is linked to consulting a \
doctor, then consulting the doctor is fated to occur together with that \
person's recovery, and this becomes a complex fact.<ref \

\[Dash] are decided by our relation to things,<ref \
name=\\\"zeller182\\\">{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=182}}</ref> or as Chrysippus \
put it, events are \\\"co-fated\\\" to occur:<ref \
name=\\\"kenny195\\\"/>\\n<blockquote>The non-destruction of one's coat, he \
says, is not fated simply, but co-fated with its being taken care of, and \
someone's being saved from his enemies is co-fated with his fleeing those \
enemies; and having children is co-fated with being willing to lie with a \
woman. ... For many things cannot occur without our being willing and indeed \
contributing a most strenuous eagerness and zeal for these things, since, he \
says, it was fated for these things to occur in conjunction with this \
personal effort. ... But it will be in our power, he says, with what is in \
our power being included in fate.<ref>[[Diogenianus]] in [[Eusebius of \
Caesarea|Eusebius]], ''[[Praeparatio evangelica]]'', vi. 8, quoted in \
{{harvnb|Inwood|Gerson|1997|p=190}}</ref></blockquote>\\nThus our actions are \
predetermined, and are causally related to the overarching network of fate, \
but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions \
remains our own.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brunschwig|Sedley|2003|p=172}}</ref> The one \

which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as \
soft-determinism, or [[compatibilism]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=152, note \

Cleromancy]] in ancient Greece. Chrysippus accepted [[divination]] as part of \
the [[causal chain]] of [[Destiny|fate]].]]\\nChrysippus also argued for the \
existence of fate based on [[divination]], which he thought there was good \
evidence for.<ref \
name=\\\"gould144-5\\\">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|pp=144\[Dash]145}}</ref> It would \
not be possible for diviners to predict the future if the future itself was \
accidental.<ref name=\\\"zeller175\\\"/> Omens and portents, he believed, are \
the natural symptoms of certain occurrences.<ref \
name=\\\"hicks947\\\">{{Harvnb|Hicks|1911|p=947}}</ref> There must be \
countless indications of the course of providence, for the most part \
unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity.<ref \
name=\\\"hicks947\\\"/> To those who argued that divination was superfluous \
as all events are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our \
behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included in the chain of \
causation.<ref name=\\\"hicks947\\\"/>\\n\\n===God===\\nThe Stoics believed \
that the universe is [[God]], and Chrysippus affirmed that \\\"the universe \
itself is God and the universal outpouring of its soul.\\\"<ref \
name=\\\"cicerodenati15\\\">Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', i. 15</ref> It is \
the guiding principle of the universe, \\\"operating in mind and reason, \
together with the common nature of things and the totality which embraces all \
existence.\\\"<ref name=\\\"cicerodenati15\\\"/> Based on these beliefs, \
physicist and philosopher [[Max Bernhard Weinstein]] identified Chrysippus as \
a [[Pandeist]].<ref>Max Bernhard Weinsten, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, \
Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' (\\\"World and \
Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature\\\") (1910), page \
233: \\\"Dieser Pandeismus, der von Chrysippos (aus Soloi 280-208 v. Chr.) \
herr\[UDoubleDot]hren soll, ist schon eine Verbindung mit dem Emanismus; Gott \
ist die Welt, insofern als diese aus seiner Substanz durch Verdichtung und \
Abk\[UDoubleDot]hlung entstanden ist und entsteht, und er sich strahlengleich \
mit seiner Substanz durch sie noch verbreitet.\\\"</ref>\\n\\nChrysippus \
sought to prove the [[existence of God]], making use of a [[teleological \
argument]]:\\n<blockquote>If there is anything that humanity cannot produce, \
the being who produces it is better than humanity. But humanity cannot \
produce the things that are in the universe \[Dash] the heavenly bodies, etc. \
The being, therefore, who produces them is superior to humanity. But who is \
there that is superior to humanity, except God? Therefore, God \
exists.<ref>Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', iii. 10. Cf. ii. 6 for the fuller \
version of this argument</ref></blockquote>\\nChrysippus spoke of God and \
gods interchangeably. He interpreted the [[Greek gods|gods]] of traditional \
Greek religion by viewing them as different aspects of the one reality. \
[[Cicero]] tells us that \\\"he further maintained that aether is that which \
people call [[Zeus]], and that the air which permeates the seas is \
[[Poseidon]], and that the earth is what is known by the name of [[Demeter]], \
and he treated in similar style the names of the other gods.\\\"<ref \
name=\\\"cicerodenati15\\\"/> In addition, the universe exists for the \
benefit of the universal god:\\n<blockquote>We should infer in the case of a \
beautiful dwelling-place that it was built for its owners and not for \
[[mice]]; we ought, therefore, in the same way to regard the universe as the \
dwelling-place of the gods.<ref name=\\\"cicerodenatiii10\\\">Cicero, ''De \
Natura Deorum'', iii. 10</ref></blockquote>\\n\\n===Theodicy===\\nIn response \
to the question of how [[evil]] could exist in a good universe, Chrysippus \
replied \\\"evil cannot be removed, nor is it well that it should be removed.\
\\\"<ref>Plutarch, ''De Stoicorum Repugnantiis'', 1051 B</ref> Firstly, he \
argued, following [[Plato]], that it was impossible for good to exist without \
evil, for justice could not be known without injustice, courage without \
cowardice, temperance without intemperance or wisdom without foolishness.<ref \
name=\\\"gelliusvii1\\\">Aulus Gellius, vii. 1</ref> Secondly, apparent evils \
exist as a consequent of nature's goodness, thus it was necessary for the \
human skull to be made from small and thin bones for reasons of utility, but \
this superior utility meant that the skull is vulnerable to blows.<ref \
name=\\\"gelliusvii1\\\"/> Thirdly, evils are distributed according to the \
rational will of Zeus, either to punish the wicked or because they are \
important to the world-order as a whole.<ref>Plutarch, ''De Stoicorum \
Repugnantiis'', 1050 E; ''De Communibus Notitiis'', 1065 B</ref> Thus evil is \
good under disguise, and is ultimately conducive to the best. Chrysippus \
compared evil to the coarse jest in the [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]]; for, \
just as the jest, though offensive in itself, improves the piece as a whole, \
\\\"so too you may criticize evil regarded by itself, yet allow that, taken \
with all else, it has its use.\\\"<ref>Plutarch, ''De Communibus Notitiis'', \
1065 D</ref>\\n\\n== Mathematics ==\\n[[File:Kegelstumpf.png|thumb|right|The \
puzzle of Democritus. If a cone is sliced horizontally, are the surfaces \
produced equal or unequal?]]\\n\\nChrysippus regarded [[Physical \
body|bodies]], surfaces, [[Line (geometry)|lines]], [[Location \
(geography)|places]], the [[Vacuum|void]] and [[time]] as all being \
[[Infinite divisibility|infinitely divisible]].<ref \
name=\\\"gould116\\\">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=116}}</ref> He determined one of \
the principal features of the [[infinite set]]: since a man and a finger have \
an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of parts as do the universe and a man, it \
cannot be said that a man has more parts than his finger, nor that the \
universe has more parts than a man.<ref \
name=\\\"gould117\\\">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=117}}</ref>\\n\\nChrysippus also \
responded to a problem first posed by [[Democritus]].<ref>Plutarch, ''De \
Communibus Notitiis'', 1079F</ref> If a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] is divided \
by a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] parallel to its base, are the surfaces of the \
segments equal or unequal? If they are equal, then the cone becomes a \
[[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]; if they are unequal, then the surface of \
the cone must be [[Step function|stepped]].<ref name=\\\"gould117\\\"/> The \
reply of Chrysippus was that the surfaces are both equal and unequal.<ref \
name=\\\"gould118\\\">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=118}}</ref> Chrysippus was, in \
effect, negating the [[law of excluded middle]] with respect to the equal and \
unequal, and thus he may have anticipated an important principle of modern \
[[infinitesimal calculus]], namely, the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] and the \
process of [[Convergent series|convergence towards a limit]].<ref \
name=\\\"gould118\\\"/>\\n\\nChrysippus was notable for claiming that \\\"[[1 \
(number)|one]]\\\" is a [[number]]. One was not always considered a number by \
the ancient Greeks since they viewed one as that by which things are \
measured. [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' \
wrote, \\\"... a measure is not the things measured, but the measure or the \
One is the beginning of number.\\\"<ref \
name=\\\"heath69\\\">{{Harvnb|Heath|1921|p=69}}</ref> Chrysippus asserted \
that one had \\\"magnitude one\\\" ({{lang-el|\[Pi]\[Lambda]\:1fc6\[Theta]\
\[Omicron]\[FinalSigma] \:1f15\[Nu]}}),<ref>[[Iamblichus]], ''in Nicom.'', \
ii. 8f; [[Syrianus]], ''in Arist. Metaph.'', Kroll 140. 9f.</ref> although \
this was not generally accepted by the Greeks, and [[Iamblichus]] wrote that \
\\\"magnitude one\\\" was a contradiction in terms.<ref \
name=\\\"heath69\\\"/>\\n\\n== Ethics ==\\n[[File:Medeia child Louvre \
K300.jpg|right|thumb|Greek [[amphora]] depicting [[Euripides]]' ''[[Medea \
(play)|Medea]]''. Chrysippus regarded [[Medea]] as a prime example of how bad \
judgments could give rise to irrational passions.<ref>[[Galen]], ''On The \
Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato'', iii.3.13\[Dash]22, iv.2.27, iv.6.19\
\[Dash]27. See also [[Epictetus]], ''[[Discourses of \
Epictetus|Discourses]]'', i.28.6\[Dash]10; ii.17.19\[Dash]23, for an example \
of this play being discussed in the setting of a Stoic \
school</ref>]]\\n\\nChrysippus taught that [[ethics]] depended on physics. In \
his ''Physical Theses'', he stated: \\\"for there is no other or more \
appropriate way of approaching the subject of good and evil on the virtues or \
happiness than from the nature of all things and the administration of the \
universe.\\\"<ref name=\\\"stock13\\\">{{Harvnb|Stock|1908|p=13}}</ref> The \
goal of life, said Chrysippus, is to live in accordance with one's experience \
of the actual course of nature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=163}}</ref> A \
person's individual nature is part of the nature of the whole universe,<ref \
name=\\\"laertius87\\\">Diogenes La\[EDoubleDot]rtius, vii. 87</ref> and thus \
life should be lived in accordance with one's own human nature as well as \
that of the universe.<ref name=\\\"laertius88\\\">Diogenes \
La\[EDoubleDot]rtius, vii. 88</ref> Human nature is ethical, and humanity is \
akin to the Divine, emanating from the primal fire or aether, which, though \
material, is the embodiment of reason; and people should conduct themselves \
accordingly.<ref \
name=\\\"davidson615\\\">{{Harvnb|Davidson|1908|p=615}}</ref> People have \
freedom, and this freedom consists in emancipation from irrational desires \
(lust, riches, position in life, domination, etc.) and in subjecting the will \
to reason.<ref name=\\\"davidson615\\\"/> Chrysippus laid the greatest stress \
on the worth and dignity of the individual, and on the power of will.<ref \
name=\\\"davidson615\\\"/>\\n\\nThe Stoics admitted between the good and the \
bad a third class of things \[Dash] the indifferent (''[[adiaphora]]'').<ref \
name=\\\"kenny282\\\">{{Harvnb|Kenny|2006|pp=282\[Dash]3}}</ref> Of things \
morally indifferent, the best includes health, and riches, and honour, and \
the worst includes sickness and poverty.<ref \
name=\\\"zeller284\\\">{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=284}}</ref> Chrysippus accepted \
that it was normal in ordinary usage to refer to the preferred indifferent \
things as \\\"good\\\",<ref name=\\\"kenny282\\\"/> but the wise person, said \
Chrysippus, uses such things without requiring them.<ref name=\\\"zeller284\\\
\"/> Practice and habit are necessary to render virtue perfect in the \
individual \[Dash] in other words, there is such a thing as moral progress, \
and character has to be built up.<ref name=\\\"davidson615\\\"/>\\n\\nThe \
Stoics sought to be free of the [[Stoic passions|unruly emotions]], which \
they regarded as being contrary to nature. The passions or emotions \
(''pathe'') are the disturbing element in right judgment.<ref \
name=\\\"davidson615\\\"/> Chrysippus wrote a whole book concerning the \
therapy of the emotions.<ref \
name=\\\"gould186\\\">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=186}}</ref> The passions are like \
diseases which depress and crush the soul, thus he sought to eradicate them \
(''[[apatheia]]'').<ref name=\\\"gould186\\\"/> Wrong judgements turn into \
passions when they gather an impetus of their own, just as, when one has \
started running, it is difficult to stop.<ref \
name=\\\"sharples68\\\">{{Harvnb|Sharples|2014|p=68}}</ref> One cannot hope \
to eradicate the emotions when one is in the heat of love or anger: this can \
only be done when one is calm.<ref \
name=\\\"gould187\\\">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=187}}</ref> Therefore, one should \
prepare in advance, and deal with the emotions in the mind as if they were \
present.<ref name=\\\"gould188\\\">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=188}}</ref> By \
applying reason to emotions such as greed, pride, or lust, one can understand \
the harm which they cause.<ref name=\\\"gould188\\\"/>\\n\\n== See also \

remembered for naming the constellation [[Coma Berenices]].\\n\\n==Life and \
work==\\nConon was born on [[Samos Island|Samos]], [[Ionia]], and possibly \
died in [[Alexandria]], [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], where he was court astronomer to \
[[Ptolemy III Euergetes]]. He named the constellation [[Coma Berenices]] \
(\\\"Berenice's Hair\\\") after Ptolemy's  wife [[Berenice II]]. She \
sacrificed her hair in exchange for her husband's safe return from the \
[[Syrian Wars|Third Syrian War]], which began in 246 BCE. When the lock of \
hair disappeared, Conon explained that the goddess had shown her favor by \
placing it in the sky. Not all Greek astronomers accepted the designation. In \
[[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'', Coma Berenices is not listed as a distinct \
constellation. However, Ptolemy does attribute several seasonal indications \
(''[[Almanac|parapegma]]'') to Conon. Conon was a friend of the mathematician \
[[Archimedes]] whom he probably met in Alexandria.\\n\\n[[Pappus of \
Alexandria|Pappus]] states that the [[spiral of Archimedes]] was discovered \
by Conon. [[Apollonius of Perga]] reported that Conon worked on [[conic \
sections]], and his work became the basis for Apollonius' fourth book of the \
''Conics''. Apollonius further reports that Conon sent some of his work to \
[[Thrasydaeus (mathematician)|Thrasydaeus]], but that it was incorrect. Since \
this work has not survived it is impossible to assess the accuracy of \
Apollonius' comment.\\n\\nIn astronomy, Conon wrote in seven books his ''De \
astrologia'', including observations on solar eclipses. Ptolemy further \
attributes seventeen \\\"signs of the seasons\\\" to Conon, although this may \
not have been given in ''De astrologia''. Seneca writes that \\\"Conon was a \
careful observer\\\" and that he \\\"recorded solar eclipses observed by the \
Egyptians\\\",<ref>[[Otto E. Neugebauer]] (1975)</ref> although the accuracy \
of this statement is doubted. The Roman [[Catullus]] writes that Conon \
\\\"discerned all the lights of the vast universe, and disclosed the risings \
and settings of the stars, how the fiery brightness of the sun is darkened, \
and how the stars retreat at fixed times.\\\"<ref>[[Ivor Bulmer-Thomas]] \
